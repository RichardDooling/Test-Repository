# CHAPTER 9: Conflicts of Interest: Loyalty and Independent Judgment

The two main CURRENT conflicts of interest rules are Model Rules 1.7 and 1.8.

## RULE 1.7: The General Conflicts Rule

Model Rule 1.7 is the GENERAL conflicts rule. The Rule itself is pretty short, but it comes with 35 COMMENTS. 

<!--RWS: deleted "(TWICE as many comments as the rule with the second most comments, which is 1.6 Confidentiality)."
-->

LIKE SO MANY MODEL RULES, it begins with a PROVISO that doesn’t make sense YET.

> Except as provided in paragraph (b) . . . 

Now there’s an awkward construction. Imagine CHARLES DICKENS starting The Tale Of Two Cities by writing: 
“Except as provided in Chapter 27, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.”

Instead, we’ll break Rule 1.7 into three parts,  

- (a)(1) We’ll call **“directly adverse”** conflicts
- (a)(2) We’ll call **“materially limited”** conflicts
- (b), as in except as provided in paragraph (b), we’ll call: **“Eek! I have a conflict! Now what?”**

Then we’ll rewrite each part in plain English, 
and talk a little bit about how it might work in a few water law contexts.

### Rule 1.7(a)

Before we do “direct adversity” and “materially limited”, let’s tamper with (a) itself. 

For the time being, pretend that the above proviso actually says: *"Except with informed consent . . ."* (which is what it USUALLY does mean)

We are now left with Rule 1.7(a) stating: 

> **1.7(a)** Except with informed consent, a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a *concurrent conflict of interest*.

<!--[RWS] unsure if this passage is necessary in the document (it would fit, but it appears redundant at first glance): 

"CONFLICTS are prohibited, but are sometimes okay if we get informed consent. 

And we know from the overview that there are two flavors of concurrent conflicts."
-->

#### Direct Adversity: Easy!


> **1.7(a)(1)** A . . . concurrent conflict . . . exists if . . . one client will be *directly adverse to another client*;

Direct adversity is usually easy, and lawyers are good at spotting direct adversity conflicts. These conflicts constitute only about 10% of disciplinary actions arising out of conflicts of interest.

These are usually litigation-type conflicts: 

* You can’t represent joint defendants in a murder trial where there’s only one shooter. 
* You probably shouldn’t represent both the driver and a passenger in an automobile accident if there’s any question about the driver’s negligence. 

The trial lawyers and the litigators have it pretty easy when it comes to conflicts (they are used to representing people who are fighting). It can trickier when lawyers are helping people form businesses or do estate planning or trying to sort out water rights. In those cases, you are often dealing with small groups of people who are NOT directly adverse . . . YET.

**HYPO**: 
> Two ranchers, John and Dave, are involved in a dispute over water rights. 

Obviously, you cannot represent both ranchers. 

**HYPO**: 
> You decide to represent ONLY John in the water rights dispute. Now a bank you regularly represent asks you to sue John on a promissory note. May you represent the bank and sue John on a promissory note?

Even if the note is totally unrelated to the water dispute AND even if John hires a separate lawyer to defend him on the promissory note, you may not agree to represent the bank,because one of your clients THE BANK would be DIRECTLY ADVERSE to another of your clients, John.

<!--[RWS] maybe think about shortening the above sentence-->

So now we have this problem: The bank is DIRECTLY ADVERSE TO JOHN under 1.7(a). But what if you have one of the other lawyers in your firm represents John? The same rationale still holds, even if the firm is a giant international law firm with 1500 lawyers all over the world: 

<!--[RWS] think about changing the wording of the last sentence-->

> If John is a dirt farmer in Western Nebraska and the bank is in Singapore. The Singapore office of Simpson and Simpson may not represent the Bank of Singapore and sue on a promissory note against John, who is clear across the world in Western Nebraska, if John is represented by the Nebraska branch of the Simpson & Simpson firm. 

<!--[RWS] change the wording of the above explanation-->

That’s pretty easy too, but you’d be surprised at how many lawyers think that they could solve this problem by having somebody else in their FIRM CLICK represent the bank instead 

Rule 1.7 Comment 6
Thus, absent consent, a lawyer may not act as an advocate in one matter against a person the lawyer represents in some other matter, even when the matters are wholly unrelated. The client as to whom the representation is directly adverse is likely to feel betrayed, and the resulting damage to the client-lawyer relationship is likely to impair the lawyer's ability to represent the client effectively. In addition, the client on whose behalf the adverse representation is undertaken reasonably may fear that the lawyer will pursue that client's case less effectively out of deference to the other client, i.e., that the representation may be materially limited by the lawyer's interest in retaining the current client.











<!--
### Concurrent Conflicts of Interest

1. The client’s interests and the *lawyer’s self interests*;
2. The lawyer’s duty to two or more *current clients*;
3. The lawyer’s duty to the lawyer’s current client and a *former client*;
4. The lawyer’s duty to a current client and a *non-client third party*;

> Rule 1.7.
> 
> (1) the representation of one client will be *directly adverse to another client*; or
>
> (2) there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be *materially limited* by the lawyer's responsibilities to *another client*, a *former client* or a *third person* or by a personal interest of the lawyer.

> (b) Notwithstanding the existence of a concurrent conflict of interest under paragraph (a), a lawyer may represent a client if:

> (1) the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client;

> (2) the representation is not prohibited by law;

> (3) the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same litigation or other proceeding before a tribunal; and

> (4) each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.
