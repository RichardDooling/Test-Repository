## Conflicts & Confidentiality**SLIDE 1**Why an aside into CONFIDENTIALITY when the topic is conflicts?Because a confidentiality problem is often the first SYMPTOM of a lurking conflict of interest.Lawyer does joint mirror wills for a husband and wife.Husband calls lawyer and says, “Don’t tell my wife but I don’t want any of the kids from her first marriage to get any of my money if I die first.” Or lawyer draws up incorporation papers for two brothers and one of them says, “Don’t tell Bill I asked you this, but if I’m the one putting all of the money into this deal, why does he get to be the majority shareholder?”Logically the lawyer owes a duty of LOYALTY TO ALL OF THE CLIENTS. There can’t be secrets between jointly represented clients. The minute one of them says: “Don’t tell X but.&hellip; ” If X is also your client, Presto! You’ve got a confidentiality problem and depending on the terms of the clients' consent, the lawyer may end up withdrawing from the representation of both clients.  Because no man can serve 2 masters.

### Presenter Notes: The original conflict of interest rule comes to us from the Bible, but that was before we had lawyers. Now we have lawyers who naturally want as many clients as possible, and so we have some really thorny rules governing conflicts of interest.

### Other: Markdown File (Conflicts: Loyalty)

The Bible: “No man can serve two masters.”BUT THAT WAS BEFORE WE HAD LAWYERS Now we have lawyers who naturally want as many clients as possible, and so we have some really thorny rules governing conflicts of interest.The two main CURRENT conflicts of interest rules are Model Rules 1.7 and 1.8. 


## Model Rule 1.7

**SLIDE 2-3**
The GENERAL CONFLICTS RULE- The client’s interests and the lawyer’s self interests;- The lawyer’s duty to two or more current clients;- The lawyer’s duty to the lawyer’s current client and a former client;- The lawyer’s duty to a current client and a non-client third party;


## Rule 1.7

<!--SLIDE 5-->

<!--**Client-Lawyer Relationship** </br>
**Rule 1.7 Conflict Of Interest: Current Clients**

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. A concurrent conflict of interest exists if:

(1) the representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client; or

(2) there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.

(b) Notwithstanding the existence of a concurrent conflict of interest under paragraph (a), a lawyer may represent a client if:

(1) the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client;

(2) the representation is not prohibited by law;

(3) the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same litigation or other proceeding before a tribunal; and

(4) each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.-->


## Model Rule 1.7 Conflict of Interest: Current Clients

<!--SLIDE 6--><!--Model Rule 1.7 is the GENERAL conflicts rule. The Rule itself is pretty short, but it comes with 35 COMMENTS. (TWICE as many comments as the rule with the second most comments, which is 1.6 Confidentiality).LIKE SO MANY MODEL RULES, it begins with a PROVISO that doesn’t make sense YET.“EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH B” Now there’s an awkward construction. Imagine CHARLES DICKENS starting The Tale Of Two Cities by writing: “Except as provided in Chapter 27, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.”Instead, we’ll break Rule 1.7 into three parts,  - A1 We’ll call “directly adverse” conflicts- A2 We’ll call “materially limited” conflicts- And B, as in except as provided in paragraph B, we’ll call: “Eek! I have a conflict! Now what?”Then we’ll rewrite each part in plain English, and talk a little bit about how it might work in a few water law contexts.-->## Rule 1.7(a)

<!--SLIDE 7--><!--### Body Except  A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. ### Presenter Notes: Before we do “direct adversity” and “materially limited”, let’s tamper with A itself:There’s our not so favorite introductory clauseLet’s replace it and pretend that it says: Except with informed consent (which is what it USUALLY does mean)And that gives us: Except with informed consent: A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest.CONFLICTS are prohibited, but sometimes they are okay if we get informed consent. And we know from the overview that there are two flavors of concurrent conflicts.-->


## Direct Adversity: Easy!
<!--SLIDE 8--><!--### Body A . . . concurrent conflict . . . exists if: one client will be directly adverse to another client; ### Presenter Notes: The first DIRECT ADVERSITY is usually easy. Lawyers are good at spotting direct adversity.Directly adverse conflicts constitute only about 10% of disciplinary actions arising out of conflicts of interest.These are usually litigation-type conflicts. You can’t represent joint defendants in a murder trial where there’s only one shooter. You probably shouldn’t represent both the driver and a passenger in an automobile accident if there’s any question about the driver’s negligence. The trial lawyers and the litigators have it pretty easy when it comes to conflicts. They are used to representing people who are fighting. It can trickier when lawyers are helping people form businesses or do estate planning or trying to sort out water rights. THERE you are often dealing with small groups of people who are NOT DIRECTLY ADVERSE . . . YET.-->


## Water Rights Dispute
<!--SLIDES 9-10--><!--### Presenter Notes: Slide 9Here is waterHere is a water rights dispute.May you represent both ranchers in a water rights dispute?You obviously can’t represent both ranchers in a water dispute.### Presenter Notes: Slide 10So, you wisely choose to represent only John in the water dispute with his neighbor.Now a bank you regularly represent asks you to sue John on a promissory note.May you represent the bank and sue John on a promissory note?Even if the note is totally unrelated to the water dispute AND even if John hires a separate lawyer to defend him on the promissory note, you may not agree to represent the bank, because one of your clients THE BANK would be DIRECTLY ADVERSE to another of your clients, John.So we have this problem. The bank is DIRECTLY ADVERSE TO JOHN under 1.7(a)I know, what if you have one of the other lawyers in your firm represents John This is true, even if the firm is a giant international law firm with 1500 lawyers all over the world. If John is a dirt farmer in Western Nebraska and the bank is in Singapore. The Singapore office of Simpson and Simpson may not represent the Bank of Singapore and sue on a promissory note against John, who is clear across the world in Western Nebraska, if John is represented by the Nebraska branch of the Simpson & Simpson firm. That’s pretty easy too, but you’d be surprised at how many lawyers think that they could solve this problem by having somebody else in their FIRM represent the bank instead Rule 1.7 Comment 6Thus, absent consent, a lawyer may not act as an advocate in one matter against a person the lawyer represents in some other matter, even when the matters are wholly unrelated. The client as to whom the representation is directly adverse is likely to feel betrayed, and the resulting damage to the client-lawyer relationship is likely to impair the lawyer's ability to represent the client effectively. In addition, the client on whose behalf the adverse representation is undertaken reasonably may fear that the lawyer will pursue that client's case less effectively out of deference to the other client, i.e., that the representation may be materially limited by the lawyer's interest in retaining the current client.-->

## Natural Resource Districts
<!--SLIDES 14-15--><!--### Presenter Notes: Slide 14When I was invited to speak here, I was asked to take a stab at addressing conflicts of interest arising out of Nebraska’s system of Natural Resource Districts. There’s not a lot written on conflict of interests in water law representation, but the ABA and others have written quite a lot about conflicts in representing other government entities, so usually we have to reason by analogy to ethical opinions about lawyers and their dealings with school boards or other govt entities.I think that the ABA would call Nebraska’s 23 Natural Resource Districts govt entity with quasi-judicial functions. So let’s look at another EASY Direct Adversity problem dealing with a hypothetical NRD.### Presenter Notes: Slide 15Let’s call this the Cornland NRD. Let’s pretend their are four board members. Let’s put Larry Lawyer on that board Or let’s say Larry REPRESENTS the board as the board’s lawyerWhile Larry is sitting on the board or representing the BOARD,  he cannot represent any of his clients appearing before the NRD.That would be the very definition of DIRECTLY ADVERSE under Rule 1.7 and AND Model Rule 1.10 imputes Larry’s conflict to his entire law firm, so NONE of the lawyers in Larry’s firm may represent clients appearing before the board while Larry is a member of the board.Again direct adversity, pretty easy.---------Imputation of conflicts “While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7 (concurrent conflicts) or Rule 1.9 (former clients)-->


## Materially Limited: Hard!

<!--SLIDE 16-->### Body A . . . conflict . . . exists if:(a)(1) . . . direct adversity(a)(2) there is a RISK that the representation . . . will be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to:### Presenter Notes: Let’s look at the hard ones, the Materially limited conflicts.These are the tricky ones, which cause roughly 85-90% of CONFLICT disciplinary actions. These deal with the CONCEPT of a RISK. 


## Risk that lawyer’s responsibilities will be materially limited by: 

<!--SLIDE 17-->### Body another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.### Presenter Notes: The RISK that the lawyer’s responsibilities will be compromised by: ANOTHER CLIENT, A FORMER CLIENT, A THIRD PERSON, THE PERSONAL INTEREST OF THE LAWYERThis is the HEART OF THE MATTER: Non-litigation Conflicts. Comments 26-28 of 1.7.You are dealing with multiple clients who like each other, even LOVE each other. They WANT to use one lawyer. It often makes sense for a family to use one estate planning lawyer. I’m sure there are situations where it makes sense for groups of farmers or ranchers to use ONE WATER RIGHTS lawyer ASSUMING THERE IS NO RISK THAT YOUR REPRESENTATION OF ANY ONE OF THEM WILL BE MATERIALLY LIMITED by your representation of any one of them.Many times it’s helpful just to constantly ask WHO IS THE CLIENT and WHO IS NOT THE CLIENT. You best friend and two other neighbors want to hire to set up a closely held corporation and represent them on a regular basis. Don’t be what commentators call a LAWYER TO THE SITUATION. Here’s a big mess. I can sort it out because I’m a lawyer and I can do what’s right by everybody. Start small. AsksWHO IS THE CLIENT? Your best friend? The two neighbors? All of them? The corporation? Even if it means your best friend comes in second behind the two neighbors.Is there a RISK of a conflict?That’s 1.7 (a): It asks the question: IS THERE A CONFLICT or a RISK of a CONFLICT, if the answer is YES, we go to 1.7(b)


## Natural Resource Districts, continued<!--SLIDES 18-19-->### Presenter Notes: Slide 18I’m told by Professor Schutz and Don Blankenau (who was good enough to tutor me over the phone) that Nebraska allocates surface water according to the doctrine of prior appropriation and that under this system PRIORITY is the crux. First in time is first in right; the senior appropriator has the highest priority to make beneficial use of surface water.Theoretically that means that Client 1 could impair clients 2, 3, and 4 in the event a dispute arises. Under the Model Rules it’s YOUR JOB, to look into your crystal ball and describe every possible event that might suddenly throw these four client’s interests out of alignment. ### Presenter Notes: Slide 19Even trickier is to take our direct-adversity NRD problem from before and turn it into a tricky materially-limited problem. Govt entities (like NRDs) often retain outside counsel for anything from regular ongoing representation to one-time special purpose engagements. Often these lawyers are simultaneously involved in representing private clients against the government. So in one sense, it’s possible that Larry sits on the Cornland Board and represents the government in one forum, while opposing the government in another another district by representing private clients before the Wheatland NRD. Based on my own shallow knowledge, it seems like these NRDS operate with relative independence. So we are not talking about these representations being DIRECTLY ADVERSE, but Larry still must be CAREFUL that his responsibilities to one client aren’t MATERIALLY LIMITED by his representation of the other. He can probably represent private clients appearing before the Wheatland NRD, even though he is also lawyer to the Cornland NRD, but he has to be vigilant if any action in either representation compromises the other. When in doubt, disclose to both  clients and obtain informed consent.Larry also has to be careful about representing, say, the Cornland NRD while representing private parties against some other govt entity in the same jurisdiction that is closely identified with the NRD. Whether Larry is seen as both representing the government and suing it is highly contextual. ---------Imputation of conflicts “While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7 (concurrent conflicts) or Rule 1.9 (former clients)


## Positional Conflicts

<!--SLIDES 20-21-->### Presenter Notes: Slide 20Also possible are what the ABA calls POSITIONAL CONFLICTS.When a lawyer is asked to advocate a position on a substantive legal issue that is directly contrary to the position being urged by the lawyer (or the lawyer's firm) on behalf of another client in a different and unrelated pending matter which is being litigated in the same jurisdiction, the lawyer, in the absence of consent by both clients after full disclosure, should refuse to accept the second representation if there is a substantial risk that the lawyer's advocacy on behalf of one client will create a legal precedent which is likely to materially undercut the legal position being urged on behalf of the other client. If the two matters are not being litigated in the same jurisdiction and there is no substantial risk that either representation will be adversely affected by the other, the lawyer may proceed with both representations. ### Help from the ABAABA Formal Opinion 97-405 “Conflicts in Representing Government Entities”ABA Formal Opinion 93-377 “Positional Conflicts”

## Nebraska § 3-501.7<!--SLIDE 23-->### Body § 3-501.7. Conflict of interest; current clients.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. A concurrent conflict of interest exists if:

(1) the representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client; or

(2) there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.

(b) Notwithstanding the existence of a concurrent conflict of interest under paragraph (a), a lawyer may represent a client if:

(1) the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client;

(2) the representation is not prohibited by law;

(3) the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same litigation or other proceeding before a tribunal; and

(4) each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.
### Presenter Notes: So part B is just what we called it. Eek I have a conflict, now what?Because it says, even if you discover direct adversity or a “materially limited” concurrent conflictYou may STILL represent the client IF:ALL FOUR of these CONDITIONS are satisfied.Note the CONJUNCTIVE!This is not OR, it’s AND## Informed Consent

<!--SLIDE 24-->### Body Notwithstanding . . . a . . . conflict , a lawyer may represent a client if:### Presenter Notes: So, did 1.7 (a) and found you have a conflict. B helps you decide if it can be cured. And now let’s look at each of those FOUR CONDITIONS separately


## Exception 1

<!--SLIDE 25-->### Body The lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer can provide competent and diligent representation.### Presenter Notes: (1)Can the lawyer manage it, Don’t gloss over this. Lawyers have a bad tendency to think they can ALWAYS provide competent and diligent representation.Also note the use of REASONABLY. So we have a REASONABLE lawyer standard.Is a REASONABLE lawyer going to believe that you were capable of representing Larry King and all 7 of his ex wives?## Exception 2

<!--SLIDE 26-->### Body The representation is not prohibited by law.### Presenter Notes: (2)Is it against the law, (some states won’t let you represent both the husband and wife) even in an amicable divorce;other states won’t let you represent both the buyer and a seller in a real estate transaction. Others say no joint defendants in capital murder cases.You just have to check.


## Exception 3

<!--SLIDE 27-->### Body The representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same litigation or other proceeding before a tribunal. ### Presenter Notes: (3) does it involve representing adverse parties in the same litigation.Rule 1.0 Terminology(m) "Tribunal" denotes a court, an arbitrator in a binding arbitration proceeding or a legislative body, administrative agency or other body acting in an adjudicative capacity. A legislative body, administrative agency or other body acts in an adjudicative capacity when a neutral official, after the presentation of evidence or legal argument by a party or parties, will render a binding legal judgment directly affecting a party's interests in a particular matter.Those three are pretty easy. Then we come to another hard one, 

## Exception 4

<!--SLIDE 28-->### Body ANDeach affected client gives INFORMED CONSENT, confirmed in writing.### Presenter Notes: “Each affected client gives informed consent confirmed in writing.”Why “confirmed in writing,” why not just a “signed writing,” as we see in some of the other rules? Why not just consent as we see in still others?## What does “confirmed” in writing mean? 

<!--SLIDE 29-->### Body Rule 1.0 Terminology(b) . . . informed consent that is given in writing by the person or a writing that a lawyer promptly transmits to the person confirming an oral informed consent.If it is not feasible to obtain or transmit the writing at the time the person gives informed consent, then the lawyer must obtain or transmit it within a reasonable time thereafter.### Presenter Notes: "Confirmed in writing," when used in reference to the informed consent of a person, denotes Give a quick lesson in how this is a nice tool for keep clients informed and making sure that your understanding jibes with their understanding of any key decision.California rule expressly requires a writing.Writing can be an e-mail and it only has to confirm the consent. IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SIGNED BY THE CLIENTModel Rule 1.0(n) separately defines a “signed” writing.Getting written consent is normally the prudent way to proceed. The writing serves as a record of the disclosures that were made and tends to bring home to both lawyer and clients that they are doing something significant.Further if the client later sues the lawyer, recollections about an oral waiver may differ.For that reason, some people argue that an oral waiver may not be worth the paper it’s printed on.


## Informed Consent: Confirmed In Writing

<!--SLIDE 30-->### Body Rule 1.7, Comment 20: “The requirement of a writing does not supplant the need in most cases for the lawyer to TALK WITH THE CLIENT . . . ” “Rather, the writing is required to impress upon the client the seriousness of the decision . . .”### Presenter Notes: Well, the ABA has something specific in mind. They want you to TALK TO THE CLIENT and EXPLAIN all of the benefits and the risks of consenting to a conflict of interest. Then they want you to send a writing—an e-mail, a letter, an engagement agreement– a writing that impresses the importance of the decision on the client. “and avoid disputes or ambiguities that might later occur.”Don’t pass up the chance to spell out the particulars. IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SIGNED BY THE CLIENT


## Informed Consent

<!--SLIDE 31-->### Body Must include specific descriptions about conflicts and risks of conflicts. Blanket general waivers are not INFORMED consent. If the risks were foreseeable risks, you have to spell them out.### Presenter Notes: Blanket general waivers are NOT informed consent. You have to identify and describe all of the conflicts and the risks of conflicts that you wisely foresaw when you assessed the representation under 1.7(a).AND you have to do that for EACH AFFECTED CLIENT.“You three chums all want to form a partnership. If you start fighting with each other, do I represent the partnership?” 
## Multiple Clients Are Fine! If . . .

<!--SLIDE 32-->### Body - helping to organize a business in which two or more clients are entrepreneurs, - working out the financial reorganization of an enterprise in which two or more clients have an interest or - arranging a property distribution in settlement of an estate.### Presenter Notes: Rule 1.7 Comment 28:  . . . .Thus, a lawyer may seek to establish or adjust a relationship between clients on an amicable and mutually advantageous basis; for example,Now you get an idea why there are so many comments. It’s impossible to prescriptively list all of the situations you will encounter.Comment 28 begins: “Whether a conflict is consentable depends on the circumstances . . . . “The real question is whether the lawyer can be counsel to the situationIs there a COMMON OBJECTIVE which the lawyer can serve that TRANSCENDS the many ways in which the parties interest otherwise differ?It requires judgment, and it’s an art, not a science. Get help if you have a question.


## Dangers!

<!--SLIDE 33-->### Body - Attorney-client privilege will NOT attach if unforeseen litigation happens.- Information imparted by one joint client will NOT be kept secret from the other. - Shared loyalty may temper the level of partisanship for each client.- Lawyer may be obligated to withdraw.### Presenter Notes: Again specific informed consent.If litigation erupts the attorney-client privilege will NOT protect our communications.No secrets.I will do my best to be loyal to everybody but that’s different than just looking out for one client’s interest.And then the big one, the next slide


## Joint Clients v. The World

<!--SLIDE 34-->

### Body

Atty-Client Privilege protects their joint communications with their lawyer from The World.

### Presenter Notes: 

Joints clients may assert the attorney-client privilege when it’s The World vs. Them.

But any ONE of them may waive the privilege when all were present for the conference or helped create the document.

If one client tells the common lawyer something relevant to the joint representation, lawyer must tell the others.

When joint clients fall out, no privilege.


## Why might clients consent?

<!--SLIDE 36-->### Body - One lawyer is cheaper than two or three.- Pooled resources.- Coordinated positions and a friendly relationship.- Parties may wish to employ a particularly valued lawyer.### Presenter Notes: Benefits and DrawbacksOn the other hand, clients seeking shared representation often do not understand the risks and disadvantages of shared counsel, such as the fact that there may be no secrets inside the joint attorney-client relationship. Nor do they necessarily comprehend that if their interests diverge unexpectedly during the representation, they will be forced to hire separate counsel, making the expected financial savings vanish. See Indiantown Realty Partners v. Brown-Haward, 270 B.R. 532 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 2001) (discussing pitfalls of joint representation). Aside from the impact on clients, the judicial system is disrupted as well when litigants have to change counsel in the middle of a case.The conflict of interest rules attempt to accommodate these competing benefits and problems by allowing multiple representation of clients whose interests may conflict only if the shared lawyer is able to provide competent representation to each client and the clients give informed consent. Model Rule 1.7; Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers §§128-31 (2000).Some critics of this compromise contend that multiple representation should never be allowed even with client consent. For example, in Bassett, Three’s a Crowd: A Proposal to Abolish Joint Representation, 32 Rutgers L.J. 387 (2001), the author asserts that clients who consent to joint representation generally fail to appreciate the risks and therefore overestimate the economic savings, and that one client often subtly pressures the other to agree, aided by the lawyer’s assurances. The ethics rules are inadequate, Bassett argues, because they impose no duty to investigate areas of conflict between potential co-clients and “ascribe far too much credit to the curative power of waiver.’’But others emphasize client choice and argue that clients who are adequately informed of the risks and disadvantages, but who nevertheless wish to employ shared counsel, should have the right to decide for themselves whether to do so, as long as the lawyer reasonably believes that she can adequately represent both clients. Collett, The Promise and Peril of Multiple Representation, 16 Rev. Litig. 567 (1997).Beyond this academic debate, multiple representation clearly entails steep risks and heavy burdens for lawyers. On top of the need to evaluate the hazards and disadvantages presented in a prospective joint representation and the obligation to explain them to the would-be clients, the shared attorney faces the added burden of remaining alert during the joint representation in case unforeseen conflicts develop, bringing the representation to a premature end and perhaps making it difficult to collect fees.Nor are those problems the limit of potential trouble. Multiple representation not only constitutes a prime source of malpractice claims, e.g., RTC Mortgage Trust 1994 N-1 v. Fidelity National Title Ins. Co., 58 F. Supp.2d 503, 15 Law. Man. Prof. Conduct 385 (D.N.J. 1999), but also provides fertile ground for disciplinary complaints, e.g., In re Beckner, 778 N.E.2d 806, 18 Law. Man. Prof. Conduct 718 (Ind. 2002).

And assuming YOU the lawyer can collect your fee, the clients will have to pay you and a whole new set of lawyers.

## Waivers

<!--SLIDE 44-45-->### Body - Local Municipality filed a motion to disqualify Martyn & Fox, claiming that Martyn & Fox cannot represent a developer in an appeal from a zoning decision because we currently represent Local Municipality on some tax collection matters. - Martyn, who is handling the zoning appeal, distinctly recalls chatting with the City Solicitor and getting a waiver. - Are we safe?### Presenter Notes: Slides 44-45Rules: MR 1.7; RLGL §97Readings: Practice Pointers: Written Consents to Conflicts of InterestResult: Depends on (1) who waived the conflict, (2) what that person or group knew when it waived, and (3) whether the terms of the waiver were reduced to a writing.Reflections: This problem raises three distinct issues.  OMAHA SCHOOL BOARDThe first is whether and how a government entity can waive a conflict.  A number of jurisdictions have statutes or rules that govern the authority of public officials in these circumstances.  RLGL §97 explains that the pursuit of the public interest can be determined by such regulations or by the discretion afforded certain public officials as part of their responsibilities.  Second, Martyn distinctly remembers getting a waiver.  Yet there is apparently no evidence that such a waiver was received. (Recall the Monco case? The patent case? Where Monco told Janus four times to get independent counsel? A writing REALLY helps.)  MR 1.7 requires a writing from lawyer to client confirming a conflicts waiver.  The writing, though the client need not sign it, and though it is no substitute for the need to talk to the client, is intended to “impress upon clients the seriousness of the decision” and to avoid disputes.  The rule was designed as much to protect lawyers as it is to protect clients, and obviously it would have been extremely helpful in this problem where suddenly the client’s memory is not so clear, a situation in which we should remind our students that the client is likely to get the benefit of the doubt.  See MR 1.7, Comment [20] and Practice Pointers: Written Consents to Conflicts of Interest.Third, are prospective waivers valid?  RLGL §122 Comment d says that advance consent to future conflicts is subject to “special scrutiny, particularly if the consent is general.”  On the other hand, clients might give informed consent in advance to types of conflicts that are familiar to the client, especially a continuing client-lawyer relationship where the lawyer is expected to act on the client’s behalf without a new engagement for each matter.  Even then, “if a material change occurs in the reasonable expectations that formed the basis of a client’s informed consent, the new conditions must be brought to the attention of the client and new informed consent obtained.”  See MR 1.7, Comment [22].


## Consent to Future Conflict

<!--SLIDE 46-->### Body Rule 1.7, Comment 22“If the consent is general and open-ended, then the consent ordinarily will be ineffective . . . .”### Presenter Notes: Consent to Future Conflict[22] Whether a lawyer may properly request a client to waive conflicts that might arise in the future is subject to the test of paragraph (b). The effectiveness of such waivers is generally determined by the extent to which the client reasonably understands the material risks that the waiver entails. The more comprehensive the explanation of the types of future representations that might arise and the actual and reasonably foreseeable adverse consequences of those representations, the greater the likelihood that the client will have the requisite understanding. Thus, if the client agrees to consent to a particular type of conflict with which the client is already familiar, then the consent ordinarily will be effective with regard to that type of conflict. If the consent is general and open-ended, then the consent ordinarily will be ineffective, because it is not reasonably likely that the client will have understood the material risks involved. On the other hand, if the client is an experienced user of the legal services involved and is reasonably informed regarding the risk that a conflict may arise, such consent is more likely to be effective, particularly if, e.g., the client is independently represented by other counsel in giving consent and the consent is limited to future conflicts unrelated to the subject of the representation. In any case, advance consent cannot be effective if the circumstances that materialize in the future are such as would make the conflict nonconsentable under paragraph (b).

Information acquired in a prior representation may have been rendered obsolete by the passage of time, a circumstance that may be relevant in determining whether two representations are substantially related. In the case of an organizational client, general knowledge of the client’s policies and practices ordinarily will not preclude a subsequent representation; on the other hand, knowledge of specific facts gained in a prior representation that are relevant to the matter in question ordinarily will preclude such a representation. A former client is not required to reveal the confidential information learned by the lawyer in order to establish a substantial risk that the lawyer has confidential information to use in the subsequent matter. A conclusion about the possession of such information may be based on the nature of the services the lawyer provided the former client and information that would in ordinary practice be learned by a lawyer providing such services.

<!--SLIDE 58-->### Body - Husband and Wife ask Martyn & Fox to prepare the papers for their dissolution of marriage.  - May Martyn & Fox represent both spouses? - Does it matter if they have already agreed to property division, child custody, and support obligations?  - What if Husband and Wife ask Martyn to mediate their disputes regarding these issues?  - If the mediation is successful, may Martyn represent both in drafting the legal papers necessary to effectuate the dissolution?### Presenter Notes: Rules: MR 1.7(b)(3), 2.4, 1.12; RLGL §§ 128, 130, Ill.6 Readings: Texas State Bar Op. 583 Result: In most jurisdictions, Martyn & Fox may not represent both but may mediate the dispute. Drafting the legal papers following mediation depends upon when the issue is addressed, whether all disputes were fully resolved in the mediation, and whether both persons consent, but in most jurisdictions probably is not consentable.Reflections: We use this common problem to illustrate an approach to conflicts that helps explain the reasoning behind the vast majority of cases. First, the lawyer should identify the conflicts which can arise from the facts in the case (e.g., the parties have children; one spouse has significant resources, the other none), the law applied to the facts (e.g., property division is required and results in a zero-sum outcome; joint or individual custody of children), and the personal relationship of the clients (e.g., amicable, abusive). Thus, even if the parties wish to avoid adversarial antagonism, the law that shapes their situation may make them directly adverse parties. Beyond law, even the most amicable divorce is likely to be layered with strong personal feelings, which Martyn & Fox is not likely to fully understand.With respect to joint representation, the view of most jurisdictions is that representing both spouses involves direct adversity under MR 1.7(a) regardless of the lack of adversarial antagonism the parties may exhibit. It follows that the conflict is not subject to consent, either because it involves representing opposing parties in litigation (MR 1.7(b)(3)) or is otherwise prohibited by law (MR 1.7(b)(2)) either family law or the application of the professional codes by courts. Even if one were to argue that dissolution represents a much less adversarial alternative than contested divorce, MR 1.7(b)(1) would create a hurdle here, because Martyn & Fox will have a difficult time providing competent and diligent representation to each, especially if one or both are hiding assets or motivations. Courts reach the same conclusion with respect to adoptions: Representing both the biological and adoptive parents constitutes a nonconsentable conflict.Mediation is different, as the Texas Opinion points out. MR 2.4 makes clear that lawyers who act as mediators do not represent the parties to the mediation, and must inform the parties of that fact. Like Texas, most state bar opinions add that not all matrimonial disputes are appropriate candidates for mediation. We find students increasingly knowledgeable about mediation and eager to discuss the different role a lawyer plays when acting as a mediator.With respect to subsequent representation, MR 1.12(a), which now governs mediation as well as other adjudicative conflicts, would allow the subsequent representation by the mediator with the parties’ informed consent, and representation by the mediator’s law firm without consent at all. Here, you may want to explore the meaning of informed consent. The Texas opinion clarifies, however, that a lawyer-mediator acting as a scrivener following the mediation, represents one or both parties. MR 1.12(b) prevents that mediator from negotiating prior or during the mediation for such a role.A few jurisdictions, such as the New York State Bar Opinion cited below, traverse new territory by suggesting that, in some limited situations, a lawyer may represent both spouses in drafting the terms of the dissolution and presenting it to the court. The ABA Section of Dispute Resolution Committee on Mediator Ethical Guidance Opinion 2010-1 takes the position that a lawyer-mediator may act as a scrivener, if she restricts her subsequent role to “memorializing the parties’ agreement without adding terms or operative language.” At the same time, it cautions that “a mediator may likely not act simply as a scrivener in this context, except perhaps in drafting a parenting plan or a more limited aspect of the total agreement.”113Finally, note that when the lawyer shifts from mediator to client representative, MR 1.12 as well as MR 1.7 again govern the matter, and most jurisdictions would not allow the joint representation. Given the economic exigencies of many divorce situations, some allow the representation of one spouse alone, with full disclosure to the other about the perils of pro se representation. See MR 4.3.Collaborative law, discussed in the ABA Opinion cited below, represents the most recent attempt to avoid adversarial litigation in the divorce context. It requires representation of both spouses, with an agreement to avoid litigation enforced by mandatory withdrawal of the lawyer should the parties decide to go to court. Most state opinions, with the exception of Colorado, cited below, agree that collaborative law can offer a constructive alternative in many family law circumstances.Careful student readers may observe that the ABA Opinion requires client consent to a limited scope representation under MR 1.2(c), but does not require any consent under MR 1.7, absent significant risk of a material limitation, perhaps because the collaborative lawyer represents only one client. Asking the students when might such a material-limitation conflict might appear gives them the opportunity to explore the commitment of the lawyer to the other party, including the commitment to withdraw if the lawyer’s client is not entirely forthcoming with all relevant information or not willing to settle outside of a court proceeding.We wonder why the ABA opinion does not require the lawyer who engages in collaborative practice to assess whether either of these possibilities is likely to occur, both before and during the representation. For example, does an imbalance in power, or emotional or physical abuse in the relationship, make collaborative law unwise from the beginning? If so, proceeding with the representation becomes “unreasonable” under both MR 1.2(c) and 1.7(b)(1).References: Bar opinions often are the best sources of information about the exact outcome of the facts in the problem in a given jurisdiction.

<!--SLIDE 63-->### Body - Two defendants are charged with murder arising from a botched bank robbery that resulted in the killing of a customer.  - Can Martyn & Fox represent both defendants?  - What if only the “shooter” is eligible for the death penalty?  - Would it matter if Martyn represents one defendant and Fox represents the other?### Presenter Notes: Rules: MR 1.7; 1.8(b), 1.10; RLGL §129; ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Defense Function Standards 4-3.5Readings: Lawyers and Clients: Criminal Defense, p. 118Result: Martyn & Fox can represent both if both give informed consent, but consent may be impossible to obtain in many circumstances.Reflections: The Restatement and the ABA Criminal Justice Standards warn that the representation of codefendants always involves at least the potential for conflicts of interest.  On the other hand, a single lawyer can help the clients maintain a common position and increase the likelihood that none will cooperate with the prosecution. Yet, because the stakes are so high and constitutional rights are at issue, conflicts in the criminal context are different.  Not only does the Sixth Amendment inform these issues, but the prosecution will take an unusually self-serving interest in the defense lawyer’s ethics.  If the students can be convinced at the outset that these two defendants should be able to exercise their right to joint counsel of their choice, to “sink or swim together,” the question is, what happens when the prosecutor calls up joint counsel and offers a deal to client A to testify against client B?  Even if the joint clients agreed at the outset of the representation to accept no deals, doesn’t counsel have an obligation to inform client A of the offer?  Give client A her best advice as to whether the deal should be accepted?  Adding in the fact that the charges are first-degree murder, the prosecutor is seeking the death penalty, but only one shot was fired simply compounds the general conflict that may exist in any joint criminal representation.  The point the students should grasp is that almost unequivocally criminal defendants really need individual representation. For all these reasons, the ABA Criminal Justice Standards warn about the potential for conflict being “so grave that ordinarily defense counsel should decline to act for more than one of several codefendants except in unusual situations when, after careful investigation, it is clear either that no conflict is likely to develop at trial, sentencing, or at any other time in the proceeding or that common representation will be advantageous to each of the codefendants represented,” and each must give full informed consent. In Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475 (1978), the Supreme Court also provided some procedural protection by holding that, where defense counsel moves for separate lawyers due to a conflict, the trial court must either grant the motion or hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the conflict exists.

<!--SKIPPED SLIDE 64-->## The Driver-Passenger Problem

<!--SLIDE 65-66-->### Body - Martyn & Fox is asked to represent driver-son and passenger-father in a lawsuit arising from an auto accident where the driver of the other car has pleaded guilty to speeding.- Can we take on this case?  - What happens when Son tells Fox before his deposition "I had two drinks before I picked up dad”?### Presenter Notes: Rules: MR 1.7; RLGL § 128 Readings: Murray v. Village of Hazel CrestResult: Martyn & Fox can take on both clients, but may be conflicted out of the entire matter if conflicts develop later.Reflections: This problem addresses a situation in which it would appear that a joint representation will present no problem. The interests of father and son seem aligned; they have a common adversary – the speeding driver of the other car. The same was not true at the outset in Murray, because each plaintiff was vying for the same top job—a zero-sum game.A useful exercise with students is to consider whether they would interview the two prospective clients together, what questions they would ask, and how they would provide informed consent. Focusing on the facts, applicable law, and the parties’ personal relationship helps inform the discussion. But, then assume that the interviews yield no specific conflicts that must be addressed, and the representation proceeds with Fox only learning later Son had been drinking. What does Fox say to Son? May he disclose his conversation to the father? Can he still represent both with an appropriate waiver? If not, can he represent either? What if Son says he has no intention of ever revealing his transgression? “After all, it wasn’t the cause of the accident,” Son intones.Generally, this is an example of a common joint representation, which can proceed except in two situations: competition for a limited fund of recovery as in Murray and Problem 9- 9(a) (Viacom/Disney), and when one party has a claim against the other, such as when Son admits his potential fault in the accident, or the other driver files a counterclaim. We use the following hypos to make these points:1. All passengers and driver seriously injured; D’s liability policy limit = $25,000. 2. Same, but D is a truck driver and company has a $5 million umbrella policy. 3. Same as #2, but truck driver files a counterclaim.Only in the second hypo could Martyn & Fox proceed with the representation. But even then, if, as in the third hypo, the truck driver filed a counterclaim, Martyn & Fox would be representing legal adversaries in litigation, a nonconsentable conflict.

We use the following hypos to make these points:1. All passengers and driver seriously injured; D’s liability policy limit = $25,000. 2. Same, but D is a truck driver and company has a $5 million umbrella policy. 3. Same as #2, but truck driver files a counterclaim.Only in the second hypo could Martyn & Fox proceed with the representation. But even then, if, as in the third hypo, the truck driver filed a counterclaim, Martyn & Fox would be representing legal adversaries in litigation, a nonconsentable conflict.

<!--SLIDE 69-->### Body - Our long-time corporate brokerage client and two of its stockbrokers have been sued for violating know-your-customer regulation.   - Can Martyn & Fox represent both the corporation and the stockbrokers?### Presenter Notes: Rules: MR 1.7 Comment [34], 1.8(f), 1.13; RLGL § 131 Ill. 3 and 4 Readings: Sanford v. Commonwealth of Virginia; Lawyers and Clients: Representing Organizations (Chapter 6)Result: Depends on whether any legally actionable conduct by the employees occurred. If it did, the conflict is nonconsentable. If not, Martyn & Fox can represent both the employer and employees, with appropriate informed consent.Reflections: This problem forces the class to come to grips with another common issue. Lawyers for organizations often are asked to represent employees of the organization as well. First, recall MR 1.13(e)’s injunction that the lawyer for the organization does not necessarily represent any constituents of the organization. That aside, the focus can shift to those circumstances in which it would be ethically permissible to represent both the organization and the employees.We based this problem on RLGL § 131 Illustrations 3 and 4. We introduced these issues in Chapter 6 in Lawyers and Clients: Representing Organizations. Once again, it pays to have students focus on the facts (whether the employee violated the law), the law (criminal, civil, Sarbanes, joint and several liability), and the relationship of the parties (some employers promise representation, either informally or in collective bargaining agreements). Here, the class is presented with a potentially explosive issue – insider trading. Violation of insider trading laws not only can affect the license of the brokerage firm, but also the employees. It also can raise criminal liability concerns.Class discussion can start from the premise that everyone is in the same boat; i.e., the employees were following the advice of someone else in the organization. Nonetheless, it should not be hard to get students to recognize how a lawyer for the organization will quickly find that advice which should be given to the employees (for example, to call the SEC and seek immunity) is not in the organization’s best interests. Similarly, if the organization wants to “disown” the employees—for example, claim the employees acted on their own or discipline the employees for their conduct—the lawyer representing both will find herself in an ethically compromised position. Recall, for example, Perez, Chapter 6, where the employee’s lawyers withdrew from representing him after he had made inculpatory admissions.The students can benefit from a careful examination of the facts in Sanford, where despite the agreement of lawyers, employer, and employees, the court finds the conflicts waiver invalid. In doing so, the court focuses on the legal and factual issues raised in the cases, concluding that no lawyer could reasonably believe joint representation would serve the individual best interests of each defendant. Of course, this requirement of Rule 1.7(b)(1) precedes any seeking of client consent. Given the facts and the law that governs the dispute, the conflict waiver quoted near the end of the case is invalid, regardless of the care with which it is drafted.You also might discuss the ethical implications of the organization hiring a lawyer to represent its employees and the implications of MR 1.8(f)’s requirement that third-party payers not interfere with the professional independence of the lawyer so paid, a topic we cover in depth in the next section. The class may quickly recognize how a corporation in that situation may be compensating a lawyer to harm the organization.Once again, the lawyer must obtain the informed consent of both to proceed; if a conflict develops during the course of the representation, Sanford illustrates that the lawyer must withdraw from the representation of both, unless both agree to allow the lawyer to continue representing one. You might want to raise the advance waiver issue here once again. Should Martyn & Fox be able to say to the employees: “If you have done nothing wrong, we can represent you and your employer. But if the facts reveal some question of wrongdoing on your part, we will withdraw from your representation and continue representing the employer.” The Sanford court leaves this issue open. How should the court resolve it on the facts in the case?Some courts refer to corporate employees represented by corporate counsel as “accommodation clients.” Others do not find this characterization helpful in the situation of joint clients who were independent corporations. For an argument that this appellation also fails to solve the problem of joint representation of corporate employees by corporate counsel see Lawrence J. Fox, Defending a Deposition of Your Organizational Client’s Employee: An Ethical Minefield Everyone Ignores, 44 S. Tex. L. Rev. 185 (2002).In our book, The Ethics of Representing Organizations: Legal Fictions for Clients p. 154-55, we include the following list of disclosures to employees by a lawyer who currently represents the organization. You might want to ask the class whether we’ve said enough.I currently represent _____ organization, not you or any other employee. I can only represent you if you have not violated the law. If you do not believe you have violated the law, but subsequent events disclose this is likely, I will not be able to continue representing you, but will continue to represent the organization. If this occurs, I will be free to disclose to the corporation anything you told me while you were my client and the corporation has the power to decide whether to disclose any information to outsiders. If I cannot continue representing you, you will have to hire new counsel. If you decide that I should represent both you and your employer, what either of you tell me will be disclosed to the other, and can be used against the other in subsequent litigation. References:Validity of Judgment: Coleman v.

<!--SLIDE 72-->### Body (b) Notwithstanding the existence of a concurrent conflict of interest under paragraph (a), a lawyer may represent a client if:
(1) the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client;(2) the representation is not prohibited by law;(3) the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same litigation or other proceeding before a tribunal; and(4) each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.## nonconsentable

<!--SLIDE 73-->### Body If a reasonable and disinterested lawyer would conclude . . . that the representation (of either client) would likely fall short, the conflict is nonconsentable.--RLGL § 122 comment (g)(iv)### Presenter Notes: RLGL § 122 (comment g(iv)) The general standard stated . . . assesses the likelihood that the lawyer will, following consent, be able to provide adequate representation to the clients. The standard includes the requirements both that the consented-to conflict not adversely affect the lawyer’s relationship with either client and that it not adversely affect the representation of either client. In general, if a reasonable and disinterested lawyer would conclude that one or more of the affected clients could not consent to the conflicted representation because the representation would likely fall short in either respect, the conflict is nonconsentable.Decisions holding that a conflict is nonconsentable often involve facts suggesting that the client, who is often unsophisticated in retaining lawyers, was not adequately informed or was incapable of adequately appreciating the risks of the conflict. Decisions involving clients sophisticated in the use of lawyers, particularly when advised by independent counsel, such as by inside legal counsel, rarely hold that a conflict is nonconsentable.## Buyer & Seller

<!--SLIDE 74-->### Body - Buyer and Seller of real estate come to Martyn & Fox to handle the deal.  - They have agreed on the price, date of closing, and identity of the property to be conveyed.  - May Martyn & Fox undertake the engagement?### Presenter Notes: Rules: MR 1.7; RLGL §130Readings: Anderson v. O’Brien; Practice Pointers: Written Consents to Conflicts of InterestResult: Depends upon the facts, law, and relationship of the parties.Reflections: This, of course, is another typical joint representation problem, where the same lawyer may act as scrivener for both buyer and seller.  Here, it seems at first blush that the representation carries no pitfalls.  Anderson then should raise the issue of a potential conflict, such as the advisability of a termite clause, a home inspection clause, or a financing clause, or loyalty to one of the parties created by a prior representation (MR 1.7 Comment [26]).  Suggesting any option may favor one party over the other, which explains why Comment [32] requires the lawyer to make clear her role as option-giver, not advice-giver or advocate.On the other hand, many provisions that might otherwise be bargained for are typically included in most agreements of sale relating to real estate.  What should Martyn & Fox do?  Most jurisdictions allow joint representation with appropriate informed consent, which O’Brien initially obtained.  But the case illustrates how quickly a conflicts waiver can devolve into an impossible and nonconsentable conflict.  The case also indicates that recklessness can be inferred from disregarding one party’s rights, resulting in potential punitive damages.  This problem or the next is a great opportunity to explore whether the lawyer confronted with this situation could find ethical sanctuary in former MR 2.2, Lawyer as Intermediary, now moved to MR 1.7 Comments [29]-[33]. The former rule was jettisoned because of concern that the rule posited a situation unlikely ever to exist: where the parties to a transaction like this could identify and resolve all of the important issues among them without the assistance of counsel. Better to act on the assumption that the lawyer was embarking on a multiple representation than to perpetuate the myth that the lawyer could really act as Justice Brandeis’ “lawyer for the situation.” (Recall Lawyers’ Roles: The Directive Lawyer and Fiduciary Duty, Chapter 6).COMMENT 32 really a form of limited scope representation under Rule 1.2(c)Anderson also can be used to highlight an additional remedy: a potential violation of the state’s Unfair Trade Practices Act.  The court’s conclusion that an unethical practice or an offense against public policy can be established by showing a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct parallels a similar conclusion in Perez, Problem 6-3, that a breach of the fiduciary duty of confidentiality also constituted a violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.## Model Rule 1.7, Comment 26\

<!--SLIDE 75-->### Body Relevant factors in determining whether there is significant potential for material limitation include:- the duration and intimacy of the lawyer's relationship with the client or clients involved, - the functions being performed by the lawyer, - the likelihood that disagreements will arise and - the likely prejudice to the client from the conflict. The question is often one of proximity and degree. ### Presenter Notes: Rule 1.7 Comment 7[comment 7] Directly adverse conflicts can also arise in transactional matters. For example, if a lawyer is asked to represent the seller of a business in negotiations with a buyer represented by the lawyer, not in the same transaction but in another, unrelated matter, the lawyer could not undertake the representation without the informed consent of each client.Nonlitigation Conflicts[comment 26] Conflicts of interest under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) arise in contexts other than litigation. For a discussion of directly adverse conflicts in transactional matters, see Comment [7]. Relevant factors in determining whether there is significant potential for material limitation include the duration and intimacy of the lawyer's relationship with the client or clients involved, the functions being performed by the lawyer, the likelihood that disagreements will arise and the likely prejudice to the client from the conflict. The question is often one of proximity and degree. See Comment [8].[comment 32] When seeking to establish or adjust a relationship between clients, the lawyer should make clear that the lawyer's role is not that of partisanship normally expected in other circumstances and, thus, that the clients may be required to assume greater responsibility for decisions than when each client is separately represented. Any limitations on the scope of the representation made necessary as a result of the common representation should be fully explained to the clients at the outset of the representation. See Rule 1.2(c).## Anderson v. O’Brien, 2005 Conn. Super

Thinking about the pre-engagement speech the lawyer must give these three is certainly a useful exercise. It will, inter alia, require the class to address the issue of how confidential information will be shared. The class also will want to consider what happens if a split develops among the partners. Will Martyn & Fox be able to represent any of them if that occurs?Factually, Martyn & Fox start with a special loyalty to the long-time client; the firm has unrelated representations and much confidential information that the client presumably wants to remain that way. The class will then want to explore how the legal interests of the “money guy” could diverge significantly from those of the future CEO. As these three sit in front of the lawyer, their hopes and dreams are as expansive as all outdoors; figuratively “holding hands,” the lawyer must envision the potential differing interests they will encounter down the road in establishing the terms of their relationship as well as operational conflicts over how the business is run. The students could profitably engage in role-play over percentage of ownership or compensation for the CEO to dramatize these points. The class also will recognize that start-ups like this rarely can afford as many lawyers to handle the various interests as some idealized ethics principles might recommend.The essential point about this kind of representation is that the lawyer’s role changes from advocate to advisor concerning relevant legal options and considerations, alternative ways of meeting common objectives, and drafting instruments necessary to accomplish the desired results. If Martyn & Fox sense that any one client is overpowering the others or, as in the case of their former client, materially limiting their ability to represent the other clients (as occurred in Anderson), they should decline the representation.References:Disqualification: Straub Clinic & Hosp. v.

<!--SLIDE 89-->### Body - Viacom and Disney are both competing for an open TV channel in New York.- Can Martyn represent Viacom while Fox represents Disney if each lawyer seeks his or her client’s consent?- What if Martyn & Fox lawyers feel comfortable taking on the representation of both?### Presenter Notes: FOR FIRST TWO QUESTIONS:Rules: MR 1.7, 1.10; RLGL §§ 121, 122, 128 Readings: Murray v. Village of Hazel Crest Result: No, competition for a limited resource is one example of a nonconsentable conflict.Reflections: We begin here by addressing MR 1.7 in the context of clients’ competition for a limited resource (one TV station) making this a direct adversity conflict, as occurred in Murray. We then move on to whether the representation of both Viacom and Disney is waiveable under 1.7(b)(1) and RLGL § 122(2)(c). That is, could a reasonable lawyer believe that a firm could represent two competitors for one license when the firm’s record in the matter will be no better than .500? Great for a batter, awful for a fielder, and not very impressive for a major law firm. Of course, once the class concludes that this is a nonconsentable conflict, the fact that Martyn & Fox feels comfortable with taking both representations makes their belief unreasonable. MR 1.10 makes Martyn’s conflict Fox’s and vice versa.This problem tests the meaning of the term “directly adverse.” Since Viacom and Disney are competing for the same channel, presumably vis-à-vis a seller or the FCC, some may be tempted to argue that, unlike a lawsuit brought by Viacom against Disney, this is not a directly adverse representation. Ultimately the class should recognize a) the potential for a lawsuit that underlies this representation and b) absent a lawsuit, this still represents a zero-sum game in which everything done to enhance Viacom’s chances diminishes Disney’s chances and vice versa. One might ask why Martyn & Fox should ever put itself in a position where, at the end of the day, one client or the other will translate its disappointment into a harsh look at how the firm handled the matter.We based this problem on facts from the testimony of Big 5 representatives before the ABA multidisciplinary practice commission, who asserted that accountants also had rules governing conflict of interest – they were just slightly different. For example, they would permit a single accounting firm to do work for both Viacom and Disney in the posited situation. Contrast that result with the facts in Maritrans, where the court granted injunctive relief when a law firm tried to represent adversaries in competing businesses.References:Civil Liability: CenTra Inc. v.

<!--SLIDE 91-->### Body If a reasonable and disinterested lawyer would conclude . . . that the representation (of either client) would likely fall short, the conflict is nonconsentable.--RLGL § 122 comment (g)(iv)### Presenter Notes: RLGL § 122 (comment g(iv)) The general standard stated . . . assesses the likelihood that the lawyer will, following consent, be able to provide adequate representation to the clients. The standard includes the requirements both that the consented-to conflict not adversely affect the lawyer’s relationship with either client and that it not adversely affect the representation of either client. In general, if a reasonable and disinterested lawyer would conclude that one or more of the affected clients could not consent to the conflicted representation because the representation would likely fall short in either respect, the conflict is nonconsentable.Decisions holding that a conflict is nonconsentable often involve facts suggesting that the client, who is often unsophisticated in retaining lawyers, was not adequately informed or was incapable of adequately appreciating the risks of the conflict. Decisions involving clients sophisticated in the use of lawyers, particularly when advised by independent counsel, such as by inside legal counsel, rarely hold that a conflict is nonconsentable.## Competition For TV Channel

Sony Corp.Result: Depends on the relationship of the entities, the potential impact on the nonclient entity, and whether any confidential information has been shared.Reflections: Eastman Kodak provides a very nuanced discussion of a late arriving, or “thrust upon” conflict caused by the client such as that described in Illustration 11 to RLGL §132.  MR 1.7 Comment [5] allows a lawyer confronted with such a conflict to choose which client it wishes to continue to represent, as long as the lawyer did not cause the conflict.  A “lawyer may have the option to withdraw from one of the representations” as long as confidences are protected and the harm to the jettisoned client is minimized.  RLGL §132 Comment j also allows withdrawal when “the matter giving rise to the conflict and requiring withdrawal comes about through the initiative of the clients.”  The court’s careful look at the dates of the Woods Oviatt law firm’s assumption of several representations led it to conclude that the law firm, not the former client, actually had the “last clear chance” to avoid the conflict.Here, if counsel for Forest Products also represents Magnum, and thus both sides in litigation, withdrawal or disqualification will be mandatory.  But it is also possible that Magnum may not be successful in the motion to disqualify.  A LACK OF SUFFICIENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ACQUIRED AND PARENT CORPORATE ENTITIES IS MORE LIKELY TO BE FOUND BY A COURT WHERE THE RELATIONSHIP OCCURS THROUGH MERGER FOLLOWING THE ONSET OF THE REPRESENTATION. Comment [34] to MR 1.7 generally agrees with ABA Formal Op. 95-390, which held that a lawyer who represents a corporate client is not by that fact alone necessarily barred from a representation adverse to a wholly-owned affiliate.  The majority in 95-390 relied on the corporate form and separate management of the subsidiary to assert that the situation does not necessarily create a conflict.  The dissenters in 95-390 relied on the fact that, no matter how organized and for what reasons (limitation of liability, regulatory, historical), all enterprises in a 100% owned corporate family are totally interdependent (Ford Motor Company is equally upset when it loses $20,000,000 in its Mercury division or its Jaguar subsidiary).  RLGL §121 Comment d and the cases in the Reporter’s Notes illustrate the fact-specific nature of the inquiry inherent in the second sentence of MR 1.7 Comment [34]:  Some circumstances might make the affiliate, as well as the represented entity, the client of the lawyer.  These include: 1) significant control of the nonclient by the client; 2) financial loss or benefit to the nonclient that will have a direct, adverse impact on the client; and 3) disclosure of confidential information of the nonclient entity.  Any or all of these might suffice to create an implied client-lawyer relationship with the affiliate.  Ultimately, as we saw in Chapter 4, the burden is on the lawyer to establish and clarify a nonclient status. RLGL §14.## Slide 112

* ABA Formal Opinion 97-405 “Conflicts in Representing Government Entities”
* ABA Formal Opinion 93-377 “Positional Conflicts”### Presenter Notes: 

When a lawyer is asked to advocate a position on a substantive legal issue that is directly contrary to the position being urged by the lawyer (or the lawyer's firm) on behalf of another client in a different and unrelated pending matter which is being litigated in the same jurisdiction, the lawyer, in the absence of consent by both clients after full disclosure, should refuse to accept the second representation if there is a substantial risk that the lawyer's advocacy on behalf of one client will create a legal precedent which is likely to materially undercut the legal position being urged on behalf of the other client. 

If the two matters are not being litigated in the same jurisdiction and there is no substantial risk that either representation will be adversely affected by the other, the lawyer may proceed with both representations. ## Positional Conflicts

<!--SLIDE 117-->### Body * Easy in terms of technical prohibitions.* Difficult in terms of “moral” obligations and loyalty.* Rule 1.7 black letter does not prohibit.* But Rule 1.7 Comment 24 suggests looking at various factors.* Real problem is when a lawyer argues for a court to CHANGE the law in a way that will hurt its other clients.### Presenter Notes: LOYALTY. People have a sense that a lawyer ought not take A’s money and then turn around and hurt A at the same time in another matter.More concrete concern might be that a lawyer might soft-pedal a plaintiff’s employment matter if she is representing big Ds in other matters.Real problem comes when lawyer is trying to get a court to CHANGE the law in a way that CANNOT help but affect its other clients.## Positional Conflicts### Body * Delaware has passed legislation that makes it very difficult to do a hostile takeover of a public company incorporated in Delaware. * Martyn & Fox is hired to defend Colossus against a hostile takeover by enforcing this legislation in a case brought in Delaware Chancery Court. * At the same time, Martyn & Fox is hired by Amalgamated Industries to seek a hostile takeover of Apex Corporation, a Delaware Corporation headquartered in Ohio. * May Martyn & Fox support the takeover of Apex by attacking the same Delaware law as unconstitutional in an action pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio?### Presenter Notes: Rules: MR 1.7 Comment [24]; RLGL § 128 Comment f Readings: None Result: Martyn & Fox can take inconsistent legal positions in different courts, but cannot challenge the provision’s constitutionality or our own work product.Reflections: Issue conflicts are as real as any other form of conflict. Yet they present some particularly difficult problems. The first is how to go about identifying them. It is easy enough at the beginning of a case to identify the parties, but the issues that will arise are often unknown. In addition, lawyers regularly take opposite sides on certain kinds of procedural and fact-specific issue conflicts. There is nothing wrong, for example, with a lawyer arguing in the morning that discovery should be limited and the plaintiff prevented from going on a fishing expedition and, in the afternoon, arguing that a fishing expedition is required to uncover wrongdoing. One thing is for sure, if it is the highest calling of our profession to argue for one proposition in the morning and another in the afternoon, one must take all steps necessary to avoid losing twice!Some issue conflicts are so serious that they are reflected in wholesale limitations on what matters a law firm will undertake. For example, in the labor law area, most firms will either represent management or represent labor. Similarly, in securities litigation, lawyers will represent shareholders or they will represent defendants.This particular problem highlights three aspects of the issue. First, the students will recognize that there is a potential conflict, but they should also consider how, unless the same lawyers were involved, this potential conflict would be identified. Second, the problem presents a question as to whether it is, in fact, an issue conflict. While issue conflicts over substantive legal questions can create conflicts of interest that require a lawyer’s attention, is the conflict here just a positional one, created by Martyn & Fox taking inconsistent legal positions? We think not. If Martyn & Fox attack their own work product, which continues to assist another client, they create a substantial risk that their advocacy will materially and adversely affect the other client. Further, attacking the constitutionality of the statute would create a precedent directly adverse to our client, and may involve some use of the first client’s confidences contrary to MR 1.8(b) or 1.9. (RLGL § 132 Comment d (ii)).Third, students might consider whether it matters where these arguments are made. RLGL §128 Comment f provides that a lawyer ordinarily may take inconsistent legal positions in different courts without seeking client consent. But where a decision for one client would create an adverse precedent for another, a conflict exists and informed consent is required. Under the former iteration of the rules, issue conflicts were considered to arise if the cases were in the same jurisdiction or before the same court. The Ethics 2000 changes reflected the fact that law is far more national today, that electronic research makes law from various jurisdictions much more accessible, and therefore, a more nuanced analysis is required about whether precedent created in one court is likely to come back and haunt a client of the firm in a different court. Of course, if a conflict exists, informed consent of both clients is required.In a rare case, a “positional” conflict might even be nonconsentable under 1.7(b)(1). Here, you might want to raise the cases of Bradwell v. Illinois, 83 U.S. 130 (1873), and Slaughter-House Cases, 83 U.S. 36 (1873), where two arguments were made by the same lawyer in the same term of the Supreme Court about the meaning of the Privileges and Immunities Clause. In the first case, lawyer Matthew Hale Carpenter argued to the court on Jan. 18, 1873, on behalf of Myra Bradwell, who was denied admission to the Illinois bar because she was a woman, that the right to labor in a business or profession was protected by the Clause. In the second, he argued on Feb. 3, 4, and 5, 1873, on behalf of the State of Louisiana that such a right was not protected by the Clause.The Court decided Slaughter-House on April 14, 1873, ruling that the right to control businesses is not transferred to the protection of the federal government under the 14th Amendment and, therefore, the states may under their police power decide to limit who may butcher animals in New Orleans. The next day, the court announced in Bradwell: “[T]he opinion just delivered in the Slaughter-House Cases... renders elaborate argumentation in the present case unnecessary; for...the right to control and regulate the granting of license to practice law in the courts of a state is one of those powers which are not transferred for its protection to the Federal government, and its exercise is in no manner governed or controlled by citizenship of the United States. ...” Bradwell, 83 U.S. at 139. Illinois was free to regulate the practice of law as it saw fit, without 14th Amendment interference. When Hale’s argument prevailed in Slaughter-House, it also guaranteed Bradwell’s defeat. Hale’s arguments are set out at 21 L. Ed. 400 (Slaughter-House) and 21 L. Ed. 443 (Bradwell).References: ABA Formal Op. 93-377 (Oct. 16, 1993) (if a court’s determination in one case is likely to have a significant impact on the determination of another case and would impair the lawyer’s effectiveness, the lawyer should not accept the second representation, unless both clients consent after full disclosure of the potential ramifications of the lawyers continuing to handle both matters).Withdrawal Granted: Williams v. State, 805 A.2d 880 (Del. 2002) (lawyer’s motion to withdraw granted with commendations to both defense counsel and the state in criminal appeal where defense counsel faced positional conflict created by prior appellate argument to the same court on behalf of a different client regarding the weight to be given jury instructions).Disqualification: Fiandaca v. Cunningham, 827 F.2d 825 (1st Cir. 1987) (lawyer who argued for one client that a state facility should be used for an expanded prison while simultaneously arguing for another client that same facility should be used for mental health treatment should have been disqualified; new trial ordered on tainted portion of case).
