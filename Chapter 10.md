# CHAPTER 10. Conflicts of Interest: Specific Rules

## A. Introduction

The conflicts discussed in this chapter have several things in common. First, they occur so often that special rules have evolved from general conflicts of interest provisions. Second, lawyers confronted by these issues cannot rely on their instincts, because personal interests color their view of the fairness of the transaction. For both these reasons, MR 1.8 has developed an almost per se approach that either prohibits or heavily regulates the conflict, which is designed both to protect clients and remind lawyers of their obligations.

### The ABA, Model Rules of Professional Conduct (1983)

Because it was Bob Kutak and the Kutak Commission who gave us the first and best WORKING version of the Model Rules. I say WORKING version because if you went to law school in the '70s or early '80s, you probably learned about the MODEL CODE of Professional Responsibility, a whirligig contraption containing Nine “Canons,” along with “Disciplinary Rules,” and “Ethical Considerations.” This was the ABA’s first effort at setting national standards for lawyer conduct. But Code was not popular because of the confusion over all the moving parts. And when you finished reading it, you still didn’t know whether contingency fees have to be in writing or whether we can allow our client to take the stand when we know they are going to lie.

What The Kutak commission did was make a Restatement out of the Model Rules basically. Much simpler: Rules and Comments, with the comments being the best part. Bob Kutak because it’s his vision of these rules that made them work and mades the rules what Bob Kutak called the “handbook of good lawyering” that was the intent of the Commission and its Chairman, Bob Kutak.

The Model Rules tend to get an underserved reputation for being tedious and dull, and if you just read the RULES, they are dull. You try to draft a rule in four or five sentences that covers every eventuality. Lots of dependent clauses. Lots of ifs, unless, except. BUT THE COMMENTS to those rules.The comments do amount to Kutak’s vision of a handbook of good lawyering, but perhaps that gets lost because often at these CLEs we plunge into some specific topic and a specific rule and so we don’t see some of these things I teach my students. Namely how to use the Model Rules as a HANDBOOK.

And how are the Model Rules holding up in the face of globalization and technology? A set of rules that were drafted for the most part back in 1983, when personal computers were just becoming available and the Internet did not exist, are now being applied to a world where lawyers talk to smartphones and meet clients on Twitter. 

Overall they’ve held up pretty well. A Rule that began by prohibiting IN-PERSON and LIVE TELEPHONE SOLICITATION now also covers REAL-TIME ELECTRONIC CONTACT in what used to be called a chatroom. Friending a person on Facebook can be an IMPROPER COMMUNICATION WITH A PERSON REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL, every bit as much as a lawyer calling them on the phone. Probably would have worked even better if the ABA had taken the Kutak Commission’s original proposals for exceptions to the confidentiality rules, because many argue that things like THIS [. . .]

### Rule 1.8

If Rule 1.7 is the GENERAL conflicts rule, Rule 1.8 is the SPECIFIC conflicts rule, 
SPECIFICALLY the conflicts that give the profession a BAD NAME: 

(a) You want to do business with your client, <br/>
(b) you want to USE your client’s confidential information <br/>
(c) you want to receive gifts from the client. <br/>

These are just three, Rules 1.8 (a)-(c). The list goes on. all the way up to (j) - having sex with your client. ABA is saying: We don’t care if you are being ethical and fair or not, we are going to make you follow specific rules for certain specific transactions because those transactions are inherently dangerous. 

If your super fiduciary spider sense tingles and you’re afraid you might have a directly adverse or materially limited conflict, yes see if it’s curable under 1.7b but also look at Rule 1.8 

### The Specific Conflicts That Give Lawyers a Bad Name

Now we visit what the Rules of Professional Conduct call SPECIFIC CONFLICTS. SPECIFICALLY, the conflicts that give the profession a BAD NAME. I encourage you to read Rule 1.8, because it’s as if the ABA said, “Let’s make a separate rule detailing all of the worst conduct we’ve ever heard about: 

* lawyers taking advantage of their clients in business transactions,
* lawyers soliciting gifts, 
* lawyers writing themselves into their client’s wills,
* lawyers trying to buy the literary or media rights to stories about their clients, 
* lawyers having sex with clients. 

All of that, and more! And we aren’t going to let you do that UNLESS you follow very specific rules. WHY? Because we are Super Fiduciaries.

### Lawyers Are Super Fiduciaries!

(the auto version)

<!-- I do not know what "the auto version" means -->

The only way I know of to protect yourself and to protect your client is to OBEY the Model Rules. Real estate agents, stock brokers, trustees, executors . . . those are fiduciaries. Lawyers are SUPER fiduciaries. Our clients come to us for advice and protection and trust and discretion. We have to be scrupulously loyal. Your instincts, no matter how good, are not enough. 

Of course, we form friendships with our clients. They may have been our friends before we became lawyers. We may have become friends after years of being their lawyer, but when a court or a client’s relative or a client’s business associate comes in and examines a lawyer’s transactions with her clients, the lawyer is not a friend, the lawyer is a SUPER FIDUCIARY. 

And the fear is that: 

* Lawyer’s judgment affected by greed;
* Client may think that the lawyer is more objective about the transaction than she really is;
* Lawyer may use confidential information to take advantage of the client.

### [Slide 7: The Iceberg Analogy]

Modern neuroscience is teaching us that our consciousness is a bit like an iceberg. About 10% of brain activity is CONSCIOUS. We are aware of it. Of course that means we are totally unaware of the other 90%. Now for the scary part: We are making unconscious decisions all day long, often BEFORE those decisions. You may be placing your interests ahead of your client and not even realizing it. 

Another way to look at that is that there’s 10% of your brain consciously in charge, so the ABA made 1.8 to protect your client from the UNCONSCIOUS parts of your brain.

David Sokol’s dealings with Lubrizol and Berkshire Hathaway. Running a $50 billion corporation and doing VERY QUESTIONABLE stock transaction to earn $3 million? That’s like you or I risking our jobs for $30 bucks? My theory is that David Sokol doesn’t know why he did it and that’s why the ABA made rule 1.8.

Common sense is useful, it is rarely sufficient to answer questions posed by Rule 1.7

### Rule 1.8(a) . 

>__(a)__ A lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquire an ownership, possessory, security or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless: <br/>
__(1)__&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the client; <br/>
>__(2)__&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the client is advised in writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel on the transaction; and <br/>
>__(3)__&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the client gives informed consent, in a writing signed by the client, to the essential terms of the transaction and the lawyer's role in the transaction, including whether the lawyer is representing the client in the transaction.

__Plain English__: A lawyer shall not do business with a client OR acquire an interest adverse to the client, UNLESS (in writing): 

* Terms are fair and reasonable, fully disclosed, and easily understood
* Client is told to have another lawyer review the terms (and given the opportunity)
* Client gives informed consent (signed by the client)
* To the essential terms
* To the lawyer’s role

Rule 1.8(a) introduces a PATTERN in these mini-rules that will become familiar. We begin with what sounds like a blanket prohibition: “A lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquire an ownership, possessory, security or pecuniary interest adverse to the client UNLESS” But before we get to the UNLESS, what kind of “BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS” are covered by Rule 1.8? 

Rule 1.8 does not normally apply to ordinary fee arrangements between client and lawyer. Those are normally governed by Rule 1.5 (8 factors looking at reasonableness, contingency fees must be in writing, etc), but we’ll see how a lawyer can unwittingly make Rule 1.8 apply to a fee arrangement in just a minute. 

But Rule 1.8(a) does NOT normally apply to fees or to to “standard or routine commercial transactions” or [. . .]

May you take your dry cleaning to your client’s laundromat? Of course.

May you eat at your client’s restaurant? [. . .]

Can you buy that Picasso your client is trying to sell? DANGER

Can you purchase property from the estate you represent? DOUBLE DANGER

With these kind of transactions, the rules step in and say, essentially, WE DON’T CARE IF YOU AND YOUR CLIENT ARE BEING FAIR EQUITABLE ETHICAL, We are here to say THAT: YOU CANNOT GET A GREAT DEAL FROM YOUR CLIENT, because you have to DISCLOSE, ADVISE and OBTAIN INFORMED CONSENT, ALL IN WRITING.

Under 1.7 we saw the Rules talking about CONSENT being CONFIRMED IN WRITING. That is NOT what we are talking about here. Doing business with a client calls for what you might call the highest formalities of the Model Rules: disclosure, advice AND consent, all in writing. 

You must DISCLOSE THE TERMS IN WRITING, they must be fair and reasonable, and EASILY UNDERSTOOD (No legalese). How do you know if they are fair? If it’s the Picasso or some land. Get an appraisal or an estimate.

You must ADVISE the client to SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL (and the client must be given the opportunity to consult) to review the terms of the deal.

Client must give INFORMED CONSENT in a writing SIGNED BY THE CLIENT. The consent prong must be SIGNED BY THE CLIENT. Consent to BOTH the essential terms AND to the LAWYER’S ROLE: Is the lawyer representing the client in this transaction OR NOT.

Applies to lawyers engaged in the sale of goods or services related to the practice of law, for example, the sale of title insurance or investment services to existing clients of the lawyer’s legal practice. 

<!-- The following were extra notes -->

BUT lawyer need not REQUIRE that client take advantage of the opportunity to seek counsel of another lawyer.

The client signing requirement was added by 2002 revisions to the Model Rules.

Rule 1.8(a)(1) : puts its bottom line focus on whether the arrangement is “fair and reasonable” to the client and . . . 
Rule 1.8(a)(1): the transaction must be “fully disclosed and transmitted in writing.”
Rule 1.8(a)(2): client must be given “reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel”
Rule 1.8(a)(3): requires “informed consent in writing” that the client signs.

### Transactions with clients are suspect! 

A trap for the unwary lawyer.
Client need NOT prove lawyer abuse.
You can get in trouble just because you did NOT jump through the Rule 1.8(a) hoops.

#### Presenter Notes: 

It doesn’t matter if the deal is fair and reasonable if you neglect to follow through with the requirements of the writing and/or the independent counsel.

<!-- The following were extra notes -->

(These cases are not from M&F)

PASSANTE and KIRSCH cases on p. 215 are designed to show that the CLIENT NEED NOT PROVE LAWYER abuse.

Lawyers put their clients’ interest first, wound up unprotected. 

A PURE HEART IS NO DEFENSE.

MERSHON case (215-216) Initially innocent acts get a lawyer into serious problems. Another land deal where Mershon took his fee as 20% of the land because the client could not afford to pay Mershon or the engineer who drew up the plat. “Hey, I know, you convey the land to a corporation: I’ll take 20%, Engineer takes 40% and you client take 40%. LITIGATED AFTER CLIENT DIED.

### Undue Influence 

__Question__: Are business contracts between attorney and client presumptively invalid as the product of undue influence?

In jurisprudence, undue influence is an equitable doctrine that involves one person taking advantage of a position of power over another person. This inequity in power between the parties can vitiate one party's consent as they are unable to freely exercise their independent will.[1]


## B. Client and Lawyer Interests

### 1. Business Transactions with Clients

#### Pay Legal Fees With Stock?

__Question__: May lawyers take all or part of their fee in the form of stock in the client’s business?

Rule 1.8, Comment [1]: We said that Rule 1.8 does not NORMALLY apply to fee arrangements; fees are governed by Rule 1.5. BUT LOOK WHAT HAPPENS if the lawyer accepts an interest in the client’s business or other nonmonetary property as payment of all or part of a fee. Now you must comply with BOTH Rule 1.5 (the fee must be reasonable) and Rule 1.8 (the terms must be fair and reasonable, must be disclosed in writing, client must be encouraged to seek independent representation. etc

<!-- The following were extra notes -->

Other problems and conflicts can arise (p. 213) ABA Formal Opinion under:

Rule 1.8(i) if company’s only asset is a cause of action “a lawyer shall not acquire a proprietary interest in a cause of action” (e.g. Okay my contingency fee is 33%, I’ll tell you what. How about I buy another 17% interest in your case for $25,000?”

or

Rule 1.7(a)(2) if the stock is a major asset of the lawyer “representation materially limited” by lawyer’s interest in the corporation.

#### PROBLEM: Paying With Stock

__PROBLEM 10-1__. It is crunch time. The initial public offering of Giggle is almost ready to proceed, But the client has run out of cash to pay counsel. Martyn suggests a 3% allocation of shares in lieu of the outstanding balance. The client gleefully accepts. The IPO is a success. Martyn, as a major shareholder of Giggle is asked to serve on the Board. 

__Rules__: MR 1.7, 1.8(a), 1.8(k); RLGL §126

__Readings__: Liggett v. Young; “It Wasn’t the Money”

__Result__: Depends on the client’s need and our compliance with very stringent conflicts rules.

__Reflections__: Students’ perspective on this particular problem has changed dramatically since we have seen the great recession. But those effects do not mean that lawyers will not in the future, as they have for generations, either be asked by the clients or desire themselves to get a piece of the action in lieu of a cash fee.

This problem gives the class an opportunity to explore several important concerns. ABA Formal Op. 00-418 systematically addresses issues raised by lawyers investing in their clients’ businesses. ABA Formal Op. 00-416 reaches similar conclusions about the impact of 1.8(a) when a lawyer purchases accounts receivable from a client and ABA Formal Op. 02-427 applies MR 1.8(a) to contractual security interests that a lawyer obtains to secure a fee.

When the lawyer takes shares in lieu of cash, the first issue is whether the lawyer is now doing business with the client and, therefore, has to conform her conduct to Rule 1.8(a). Here, we explain how general conflicts rules such as MR 1.7 developed into more specific regulations, such as those in MR 1.8, because lawyers like Young continued to misunderstand the exact nature of their fiduciary responsibility. 

Second, MR 1.8(a) directs the lawyer’s attention to whether and how the lawyer’s independence might be compromised in terms of providing the client objective advice when the only way the lawyer gets paid is if stock is, in fact, issued. Here we find it helpful to ask students precisely what Young did wrong, and then to consider how they would determine the fair value of various amounts of stock. 

Third, there are significant liability concerns raised by a payment of this type. If, in fact, the stock subsequently falters, the lawyer who received stock on the public offering is far more likely to be named a defendant than if the lawyer had simply been paid a fee. In addition, the argument that the lawyer was a principal, not just an aider or abettor of the fraudulent conduct, is more likely to prevail in this connection. 

Liggett introduces another remedy: Cancellation of the agreement due to undue influence. In our problem, this would mean failure to comply with the heightened obligations in the rule would result in no stock at all. Note that for Liggett cancellation of the “Additional Covenants” clause also will entitle him to receive appropriate payment as damages for breach of fiduciary duty to compensate him for the additional work performed. 

The second portion of this problem answers the question of whether a lawyer should agree to sit on the board of directors of a client company.  ”It Wasn’t the Money” illustrates the truth that lawyers are flattered by such requests and view these opportunities as providing them with an effective means of cementing the lawyer-client relationship.  Lawyers also will like very much the fees to which they might become entitled, as well as rubbing elbows with the great and near great who serve on the board.

Notwithstanding all those desirable effects, real ethical problems can arise.  First, the lawyer must worry about which hat the lawyer is wearing at any given time.  Could the lawyer, as a lawyer, be required to give advice that is different from the advice the lawyer might give in the role as director?  

Second, there is the difficulty of determining whether the lawyer’s advice will be subject to the privilege.  In a world where privilege is constantly under attack, the wearing of two hats will be used by those who wish to tear down the privilege.  

“She was acting as a director, and there is no director-company privilege.”  

Third, the relationship between the client and the director’s law firm will be subject to allegations of self-dealing and intense scrutiny of the legal fees as would any transaction between the company and an entity owned by a director.  

Fourth, just when the director’s law firm might be most needed by the company – a major crisis or critical litigation – the law firm may be conflicted out because the law firm is either a co-defendant or the law firm’s advice is particularly subject to challenge.  

Fifth, though there is no empirical data to prove the point, it is received wisdom that the likelihood of the law firm being sued in connection with its work for a company increases if a lawyer from that firm sits on the board.

We like to encourage our students to serve on boards of directors when they become lawyers.  We like to think that lawyers make terrific board members.  Our advice here is simply not to become a director of an organization that is a client of the firm. One exception might be some non-profits, especially when they may not be able to survive without a lawyer’s pro bono service as both lawyer and director.

#### Liggett d/b/a Liggett Construction Co v. Young (Ind. 2007)

<!-- Haven't really done much with this section -->

So Liggett, a builder, builds a house for his lawyer. Is Young doing business with his client within the meaning of Rule 1.8(a)? [YES]

The Question: Are business contracts between attorney and client presumptively invalid as the product of undue influence?

The plaintiff, Ronald Liggett, d/b/a Liggett Construction Company, appeals to challenge a trial court summary judgment ruling in a contract dispute arising from Liggett's construction of a private residence for his attorney, defendant Dean Young, and Young's wife, Elisabeth. . . . 

In 2001, when sued by a supplier of bricks and materials used in the construction of the Youngs' home, Liggett initiated a third-party complaint against the Youngs. 

The Youngs' answer included a counterclaim against Liggett seeking damages for allegedly negligent and untimely performance of the work under the building contract. . . . [T]he trial court granted partial summary judgment and . . . entered final judgment in favor of the Youngs and against Liggett as to all of Liggett’s claims against the Youngs. . . .
 
Among Liggett's issues on appeal, we find one to be dispositive: "Whether the trial judge erred in finding no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the enforceability of a contract drafted and entered into between an attorney and his builder/client." . . . 

1. Professional Conduct Rule 1.8 

Liggett's appeal contends in part that the Youngs failed to carry their burden on summary judgment to prove that the construction contract was not void by reason of Indiana Professional Conduct Rule 1.8, which restricts an attorney's ability to engage in transactions with the attorney's client. Liggett urges that Dean Young violated this rule by drafting the construction contract for the project, and that attorney/client transactions are presumptively invalid as the product of undue influence. 

In response, the Youngs contend (a) that Liggett's designation of evidence on summary judgment, claiming an entitlement to receive the contract price plus an additional amount, is inconsistent with his claim that the contract should be found void, and (b) that the construction contract was a standard commercial transaction to which Rule 1.8 does not apply. . . . 

In this diagram the red arrows show the “might as well” work that Young argued he did not have to pay for.

#### Model Rule 1.8(a) (doing business with client) Comment 1

__Rule 1.8, Comment [1]: Business Transactions Between Client and Lawyer__ <br/>
A lawyer's legal skill and training, together with the relationship of trust and confidence between lawyer and client, create the possibility of overreaching when the lawyer participates in a business, property or financial transaction with a client, for example, a loan or sales transaction or a lawyer investment on behalf of a client. The requirements of paragraph (a) must be met even when the transaction is not closely related to the subject matter of the representation, as when a lawyer drafting a will for a client learns that the client needs money for unrelated expenses and offers to make a loan to the client. The Rule applies to lawyers engaged in the sale of goods or services related to the practice of law, for example, the sale of title insurance or investment services to existing clients of the lawyer's legal practice. See Rule 5.7. It also applies to lawyers purchasing property from estates they represent. It does not apply to ordinary fee arrangements between client and lawyer, which are governed by Rule 1.5, although its requirements must be met when the lawyer accepts an interest in the client's business or other nonmonetary property as payment of all or part of a fee. In addition, __the Rule does not apply to standard commercial transactions between the lawyer and the client for products or services that the client generally markets to others__, _for example, banking or brokerage services, medical services, products manufactured or distributed by the client, and utilities' services. In such transactions, the lawyer has no advantage in dealing with the client, and the restrictions in paragraph (a) are unnecessary and impracticable_.

<!-- Bolded text cited in slide; italicized portion found in Presenter Notes -->

__Plain English__: 1.8(a) does not apply to standard commercial transactions between the lawyer and the client for products or services that the client generally markets to others. 

<!-- I have not done anything with the following few paragraphs (unsure where they came from) -->

“We conclude there exists an independent common law basis, apart from violation of Rule 1.8 on which a client may seek recourse in damages.

Common law attorney-client fiduciary duty.

The requirements of paragraph (a) must be met even when the transaction is not closely related to the subject matter of the representation, as when a lawyer drafting a will for a client learns that the client needs money for unrelated expenses and offers to make a loan to the client. The Rule applies to lawyers engaged in the sale of goods or services related to the practice of law, for example, the sale of title insurance or investment services to existing clients of the lawyer's legal practice. See Rule 5.7. It also applies to lawyers purchasing property from estates they represent.

It does not apply to ordinary fee arrangements between client and lawyer, which are governed by Rule 1.5, although its requirements must be met when the lawyer accepts an interest in the client's business or other nonmonetary property as payment of all or part of a fee. In addition, the Rule does not apply to standard commercial transactions between the lawyer and the client for products or services that the client generally markets to others, for example, banking or brokerage services, medical services, products manufactured or distributed by the client, and utilities' services. In such transactions, the lawyer has no advantage in dealing with the client, and the restrictions in paragraph (a) are unnecessary and impracticable.

## Rule 1.8(b) 

>__Rule 1.8(b)__ <br/>
>A lawyer shall not use information relating to representation of a client to the disadvantage of the client unless the client gives informed consent, except as permitted or required by these Rules.

__Plain English__: A lawyer SHALL NOT USE information relating to representation to the DISADVANTAGE of the client, UNLESS client gives informed consent.

__History of the prohibition__: (page 4 of the outline) outlines the inherent tension that tension
Should the rule be that the lawyer cannot USE client information PERIOD (unless the client gives informed consent) or should the rule be the lawyer doesn’t need client consent, as long as the USE does not disadvantage the client.

Earlier rules were inspired by AGENCY LAW. Typical rule is that the AGENT may not use secret information of the PRINCIPAL without consent. Remedy is disgorgement of profit!

Lawyer can always ASK the client/principal for permission, and if client consents, lawyer is home free.

But if client refuses (or if lawyer NEVER seeks consent) lawyer is accountable to client for profits under:
• Restatement Second Agency §388 (“restitutionary relief in the form of disgorgement of profit”);
• Restatement Third Law Governing Lawyers §60 (“lawyer who uses confidential information of a client for the lawyer’s pecuniary gain other than in the practice of law must account to the client for any profits made”)

BEFORE NEXT SLIDE: WHAT IS INFORMATION RELATING TO THE REPRESENTATION?

<!-- Do you want to use the above statement to segue into the next section? -->

<!-- The following were extra notes -->

EXCEPTIONS CONTAINED IN OTHER RULES

1.2(d) lawyer shall not counsel a client to commit criminal or fraudulent act
1.6 confidentiality
4.1(b) fail to disclose material fact when necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client.
3.3 Candor toward the tribunal
8.1 Bar Admission & Disciplinary matters
8.3 Reporting professional misconduct

• ABA Canons of Professional Ethics (1908): “The Lawyer should refrain from ANY ACTION whereby for his personal benefit or gain he abuses or takes advantage of the confidence reposed in him by his client.”
• Model Code DR 4-101(B)(3) (1981) (equally definitive) absent informed client consent, a lawyer may not “knowingly ...use a confidence or secret of his client for the advantage OF HIMSELF or of a third person.”
• Model Rule 1.8(b) lawyer “shall not use information relating to representation of a client to the DISADVANTAGE OF THE CLIENT” unless client consents.

## Client Confidences

Rule 1.6: "A lawyer shall not REVEAL information . . ."
Rule 1.8(b): "A lawyer shall not USE information . . ."

Rule 1.6 deals with DISCLOSURE of client information Rule 1.8(b) deals with USE. But the important concept is that we are talking about “INFORMATION RELATING TO THE REPRESENTATION OF A CLIENT,” which is a lot more than INFORMATION PROTECTED BY THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

### Investments Using  Client Information

Client wants to build a new stadium, which will cause surrounding properties to rise in value.
attorney (without Client’s consent) buys a nearby parcel after concluding that Client probably does not plan to buy it. Can she do that? 

Look at the evolution of the rule:

1908 Canon “Lawyer shall refrain from taking advantage of any confidence”

Model Code DR 4-101 Without informed consent lawyer may NOT use secret or advantage of client.

Model Rule 1.8(b) lawyer “shall not use information relating to representation of a client to the DISADVANTAGE OF THE CLIENT” unless client consents.

Earlier rules were inspired by AGENCY LAW. Typical rule is that AGENT may not use secret information of PRINCIPAL without consent. Remedy is disgorgement of profit!

Lawyer can always ASK the client/principal for permission and if client consents, lawyer is home free. But if client refuses (or if lawyer NEVER seeks consent) lawyer is accountable to client for profits under Restatement 2nd Agency section 388 and under the Restatement Third Law Governing Lawyers section 60 (see page 218)

What about INSIDER TRADING? If focus on harm to the client, then it would not violate 1.8(b). But see Rule 8.4(c) “It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to commit a criminal act”


### 2. Gifts, Rights, Loans, and Aggregate Settlements

#### Rule 1.8(c): Gifts

>__Rule 1.8(c)__ <br/>
A lawyer shall not solicit any substantial gift from a client, including a testamentary gift, or prepare on behalf of a client an instrument giving the lawyer or a person related to the lawyer any substantial gift unless the lawyer or other recipient of the gift is related to the client. For purposes of this paragraph, related persons include a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent or other relative or individual with whom the lawyer or the client maintains a close, familial relationship.

__Plain English__: A lawyer shall NOT solicit any substantial gift from a client (including a testamentary gift) or prepare an instrument giving the lawyer any substantial gift, UNLESS THE CLIENT IS A RELATIVE.

The Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers says UNLESS THE LAWYER IS A “relative or OTHER NATURAL OBJECT OF THE CLIENT’S GENEROSITY.” So the key blanket prohibitions go like this: 

>Unless you are a relative or other natural object of the client’s generosity, DO NOT SOLICIT SUBSTANTIAL GIFTS, DO NOT PREPARE AN INSTRUMENT

What sort of close familial relationship? Like Robin is Bruce Wayne’s ward.

Bit of a paradox here, at least under the MODEL RULES:

>Dear Rick:
>
>Because you have been such a great lawyer to me over the years, please draw up the documents transferring title in this $35,000 Mercedes to your name.

>Dear Rick because you have been such a great lawyer to me over the years, please accept this $35,000 Rolex Oyster Perpetual Yacht-Master II Mens Watch (WHICH YOU DID NOT SOLICIT)

OKAY, WHAT IF YOU DON’T SOLICIT THE SUBSTANTIAL GIFT AND YOU DON’T PREPARE ANY INSTRUMENT GIVING YOURSELF A SUBSTANTIAL GIFT, THE CLIENT JUST WANTS TO GIVE YOU A SUBSTANTIAL GIFT. Rule 1.8 would permit this, with a caveat contained in Rule 1.8, Comment 6? The gift “may be voidable by the client under the doctrine of undue influence, which treats client gifts as presumptively fraudulent.”

THE REARVIEW MIRROR. Years later, your clients heirs are going to be asking: “What happened to Dad’s Rolex?” Oh, the LAWYER GOT IT. He’s okay under the Model Rules but let’s sue him in equity for exercising undue influence on Dad. Rule 1.8(c) does not prohibit substantial gifts no matter how large IF THE LAWYER IS DRAFTING NO INSTRUMENT. When courts try to figure out what is a SUBSTANTIAL GIFT they look at either the client’s resources, or the lawyers, or both.

$30,200.00 You Save: $3,450.00 (10%)

#### RLGL 3rd § 127(2) 

>__RLGL § 127(2) . A Client Gift to a Lawyer__
>
>__(2)__ A lawyer may not accept a gift from a client, including a testamentary gift, unless: <br/>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(a)__ the lawyer is a relative or other natural object of the client's generosity; <br/>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(b)__ the value conferred by the client and the benefit to the lawyer are insubstantial in amount; or <br/>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(c)__ the client, before making the gift, has received independent advice or has been encouraged, and given a reasonable opportunity, to seek such advice.

__Plain English__: A lawyer MAY NOT accept a gift from a client, UNLESS: 

* Lawyer is a relative;
* Value is insubstantial; OR
* Client has received independent advice or has been encouraged to seek such advice

Note we are dealing here only with the ETHICAL RULES, the Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers says, NO SUBSTANTIAL GIFTS, PERIOD. 

Because the Restatement deals with all laws governing lawyers, not just ethical rules, and thought I that the equitable doctrine of undue influence allows for the rescission of a gift or contract arising out of a relationship of influence 

<!-- The following were extra notes -->

DOCTRINE OF UNDUE INFLUENCE
Influence of another that destroys the requisite free will of a Testator or Donor and creates a ground for nullifying a Will or invalidating an improvident Gift. 
The exercise of undue influence is suggested by excessive insistence, superiority of will or mind, the relationship of the parties or pressure on the donor or testator by any other means to do what he is unable, practically, to refuse.

#### RLGL 3rd § 127(1)  

__RLGL § 127(1) __

__(1)__ A lawyer may not prepare any instrument effecting any gift from a client to the lawyer, including a testamentary gift, unless the lawyer is a relative or other natural object of the client's generosity and the gift is not significantly disproportionate to those given other donees similarly related to the donor.

__Plain English__: A Lawyer May Not:

Prepare any instrument effecting ANY gift (including a testamentary gift) from a client to the lawyer, UNLESS: 

* Lawyer is a natural object of client’s generosity 
* Gift is not disproportionate to those given other donees

You prepare your father’s will, in which your father leaves half of his estate to you and a fourth of his estate to each of your brothers. The RESTATEMENT says that you have a problem.

#### Testamentary Gifts & Lawyer As Executor 

Main witness (the client) will be dead! Rule 1.8, Comment [8]: “does not prohibit a lawyer from seeking to have the lawyer . . . named as executor of the client’s estate” or other lucrative position. But see Rule 1.7 conflict of interest!

You’ll be relieved to learn that Comment [8] explicitly state that you can still name yourself as executor of the client’s estate or some other fiduciary position. Comment [8] requires the lawyer to secure the client’s “informed consent” when the lawyer’s personal interest would itself create a conflict. CLIENT WILL NOT BE AROUND! PUT IT IN WRITING!

Rule 1.8(c) prohibits a lawyer from writing a will that gives her a substantial gift if the client is not a relative. 

#### Presumptively Invalid . . .

* Transactions entered into during the existence of a fiduciary relationship are presumptively invalid as the product of undue influence. 
* Transactions between an attorney and client are presumed to be fraudulent, so that the attorney has the burden of proving fairness and honesty.

Young (the attorney) used a form contract and at the top it said “the selection of a form of instrument, filling in blank spaces, striking out provisions and inserting special clauses constitutes the practice of law AND SHOULD BE DONE BY A LAWYER. Young added ADDITIONAL COVENANTS. 

Judge Boehm concurring:

Ligget claims tthat the parties agreed to oral change orders and that a variety of change orders added substantially to the cost of the project. He seeks compensation for those

The “transaction” at issue as to Liggett’s claims is not the original contract which on its face seems to me to be relatively ordinary and not “unfair”. Rather the CHANGE ORDERS are the “transactions” for which Liggett seks compensation. The Youngs do not deny that the changes were requested AND SEEK TO INVOKE A PROVISION IN THE CONTRACT DEAN YOUNG PREPARED that requires change requests be in writing.

#### PROBLEM: Wearing Two Hats

__Problem 10-2__. Great business development idea! Martyn & Fox should insert a clause in all of its estate planning documents that appoints a Martyn & Fox lawyer as the fiduciary (executor, administrator, or personal representative) of an estate or trustee of a trust. Then when Martyn & Fox lawyers act as fiduciary, the fiduciary hires Martyn & Fox as counsel for the trust or estate.

__Rules__: MR 1.4, 1.7, 1.8(a)(c)

__Result__: Martyn & Fox should not insert the clause without explicit client consent after the client has been informed of all other options.

__Reflections__: We begin this problem by considering why, in general, lawyers cannot draft documents that name them as beneficiaries. MR 1.8(c) prohibits both the solicitation of such gifts and the drafting of documents that name the lawyer as beneficiary. Comments [6] and [7] refer to the related law of undue influence relied on in Liggett. We also note that a lawyer who relies on the “related to the client” exception in the black letter might nevertheless draft a document subject to a presumption of undue influence. 

We based this problem on ABA Formal Op. 02-426, Lawyer Serving as Fiduciary for an Estate or Trust. With respect to the first question, the Committee concluded that a properly made designation does not violate MR 1.8(c) because accepting the appointment as fiduciary is not accepting a gift from the client, and is not a business transaction subject to MR 1.8(a); see, Comment [8]. 

The Committee found that the lawyer may serve as fiduciary as long as she complies with MR 1.4(b) by disclosing the availability of others to serve, the advantages and disadvantages of each option, and the client gives informed consent. The lawyer may well be the one “best suited to serve,” because she “may be familiar with the family circumstances and the client’s wishes regarding multiple family beneficiaries who may have widely different financial needs and goals.” Of course, routinely adding Martyn & Fox as fiduciary without this disclosure and conversation would violate the lawyer’s obligation to obtain informed consent.

With respect to the second question, the ABA Committee also approved of the practice of the lawyer or law firm representing the lawyer as fiduciary, because the dual role does not involve a conflict of interest. 

The opinion admits, however, that “issues may arise regarding the reasonableness of the compensation that the lawyer and his firm receive in the dual capacities,” and point out that when full compensation for time and labor is made through fiduciary compensation, the same time and labor may not properly be given “full weight under MR 1.5(a)(1).” 

It also recommends approval of the amount of compensation by a cofiduciary or the beneficiaries as “persuasive in establishing the reasonableness of the legal fees.” You may want to refer students to statutes or cases in your jurisdiction that regulate fiduciary compensation, some of which the ABA Opinion cites. 

__Query__: Although the opinion does not cite MR 1.7, aren’t the lawyer’s personal interests in compensation in this circumstance enough to require some disclosure about the lawyer’s financial interest beyond the reasonableness considerations in MR 1.5? For an argument that MR 1.8(c) is not stringent enough, see, Paula A. Monopoli, Drafting Attorneys as Fiduciaries: Fashioning an Optimal Ethical Rule for Conflicts of Interest, 66 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 411 (2005).

## PROBLEM: The Offer

__Problem 10-5__. A real tragedy. An automobile accident resulting in the death of Wife and serious injuries to Daughter and Grandmother. Martyn & Fox undertook the representation of Daughter and Grandmother, as well as the estate of Wife. Defendant’s insurer offers policy limits of $1,000,000 to settle all claims. Should Martyn & Fox accept the offer?

__Rules__: MR 1.8(g); RLGL §§6, 37

__Readings__: Burrow v. Arce; The Law Governing Lawyers: Loss of Fee or Other Benefits

__Result__: Depends on whether we can comply with MR 1.8(g).

__Reflections__: Burrow illustrates the problems with aggregate settlements and introduces a new remedy: fee forfeiture. Whenever a lawyer represents multiple parties in the same matter and the opposing party proposes to settle their claims for a lump sum, the lawyer must comply with MR 1.8(g) in order to protect each client’s individual right to consent or refuse to consent to the settlement.

With respect to the fee forfeiture remedy, we find it interesting to speculate on the facts on remand. What if, for example, the lawyers in Burrow had worked up each case as to damages but pooled their work regarding liability issues in the case? Or what if (as the plaintiffs allege) they just got $190 million and told each client they would get $1 million without even requesting their medical records? You also might want to ask why clients in other breach of fiduciary duty cases so far did not ask for the fee forfeiture remedy. 

In both dePape and Perez, the client didn’t personally pay for the lawyer and suffered damages of another sort. Contrast those cases with Burrow, where proof of causation and damages will be difficult, but the fee is significant. 

__The Law Governing Lawyers__: Loss of Fee or Other Benefits addresses these questions and also points out that equitable remedies may overlap in some cases. We sometimes raise the latter issue by asking what other relief Maritrans could seek after it obtained injunctive relief. Recall that Maritrans apparently continued to pay the law firm while the firm labored under the conflict of interest the court later enjoined, making partial fee disgorgement a possibility.

#### Rule 1.14. Client With Diminished Capacity

__Rule 1.14.__

__(b)__ __When the lawyer reasonably believes that the client has diminished capacity__, _is at risk of substantial physical, financial or other harm unless action is taken and cannot adequately act in the client's own interest,_ __the lawyer may take reasonably necessary protective action__, _including consulting with individuals or entities that have the ability to take action to protect the client and, in appropriate cases, seeking the appointment of a guardian ad litem, conservator or guardian._ <br/>
__(c)__ Information relating to the representation of a client with diminished capacity is protected by Rule 1.6. __When taking protective action pursuant to paragraph (b), the lawyer is impliedly authorized under Rule 1.6(a) to reveal information about the client, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the client's interests.__

__Plain English:__
__(b)__ When the lawyer reasonably believes that the client has diminished capacity, the lawyer may take reasonably necessary protective action
__(c)__ When taking protective action pursuant to paragraph (b), the lawyer is impliedly authorized under Rule 1.6(a) to reveal information about the client, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the client's interests.

#### Burrow v. Arce (Tex 1999)

Explosion at Phillips 66 Plant kills 23 and injures hundreds. Wrongful death and personal injury suits. Lawyers file one suit representing 126 Ps. Case settles for $190 million with a $60 million contingency fee. 49 Ps then sue their attorneys alleging professional misconduct and demanding forfeiture of all fees.

Clients say that lawyers signed up Ps en masse, lied about contingency fee amounts (33% rather than 25%), settled in the aggregate without regard to individual conditions and damages.

Lawyers say NO AGGREGATE SETTLEMENT this is just an attempt to extort more money.

District Court grants summary judgment for lawyers saying this is fair and reasonable settlement, therefore Ps did not suffer an actual dmx and absent actual dmx ps were not entitled to forfeiture.

On appeal, the clients contend that full forfeiture is called for (whether actual dmx or not) or if less than full forfeiture that should be determined by a jury not the judge.

#### Rule 1.8(g) 

>A lawyer who represents two or more clients shall not participate in making an aggregate settlement of the claims of or against the clients, or in a criminal case an aggregated agreement as to guilty or nolo contendere pleas, unless each client gives informed consent, in a writing signed by the client. The lawyer's disclosure shall include the existence and nature of all the claims or pleas involved and of the participation of each person in the settlement.

__Plain English:__ No Aggregate Settlements, UNLESS:

* Each client gives informed consent in a writing signed by the client;
* Lawyer’s disclosure shall include nature of all claims or pleas and participation of EACH PERSON to the settlement.


#### Actual Damages 

Are actual damages a prerequisite to fee forfeiture?

## RLGL § 37: Fee Forfeiture

__RLGL § 37: Partial or Complete Forfeiture of a Lawyer's Compensation__
A lawyer engaging in clear and serious violation of duty to a client may be required to forfeit some or all of the lawyer's compensation for the matter. Considerations relevant to the question of forfeiture include the gravity and timing of the violation, its willfulness, its effect on the value of the lawyer's work for the client, any other threatened or actual harm to the client, and the adequacy of other remedies.

__Plain English__: 
A lawyer engaging in clear and serious violation of duty to a client may be required to forfeit some or all of the lawyer’s compensation. Considerations: 

* gravity and timing of violation;
* willfulness
* effect on the value of the lawyer’s work 
* any other threatened or actual harm to the client
* adequacy of other remedies

The Burrow court added something: 

>To the factors listed in section 37 we add another that must be given great weight in applying the remedy of fee forfeiture: “The public interest in maintaining the integrity of attorney-client relationships.”

## RLGL § 37: Fee Forfeiture comment e

> __RLGL § 37, Comment e: Extent of forfeiture__
> 
> __Ordinarily, forfeiture extends to all fees for the matter for which the lawyer was retained__, such as defending a criminal prosecution or incorporating a corporation. (For a possibly more limited loss of fees under other rules, see Comment a hereto.) See § 42 (client's suit for refund of fees already paid). Forfeiture does not extend to a disbursement made by the lawyer to the extent it has conferred a benefit on the client (see § 40, Comment d).
> 
> __Sometimes forfeiture for the entire matter is inappropriate, for example when a lawyer performed valuable services before the misconduct began__, and the misconduct was not so grave as to require forfeiture of the fee for all services. Ultimately the question is one of fairness in view of the seriousness of the lawyer's violation and considering the special duties imposed on lawyers, the gravity, timing, and likely consequences to the client of the lawyer's misbehavior, and the connection between the various services performed by the lawyer.

__Plain English__: “Ordinarily, forfeiture extends to all fees for the matter for which the lawyer was retained . . .” Yikes! But see: “Sometimes forfeiture for the entire matter is inappropriate . . . when a lawyer performed valuable services before the misconduct began . . .”

#### Amount of fee?

A question of fact for the jury? A question of law for the court? It's a question of law for the court. It’s an equitable remedy similar to a constructive trust p. 363

#### Burrow Ps Entitled to Fee Forfeiture?

If allegations are true, are the Ps entitled to forfeiture of any or all of the attorneys fees in this case?

#### Fee Forfeiture Automatic?

And entire for all misconduct?

#### Rule 1.8, Comment [13]: Aggregate Settlements

>Differences in willingness to make or accept an offer of settlement are among the risks of common representation of multiple clients by a single lawyer. Under Rule 1.7, this is one of the risks that should be discussed before undertaking the representation, as part of the process of obtaining the clients' informed consent. In addition, __Rule 1.2(a) protects each client's right to have the final say in deciding whether to accept or reject an offer of settlement and in deciding whether to enter a guilty or nolo contendere plea in a criminal case.__ The rule stated in this paragraph is a corollary of both these Rules and provides that, before any settlement offer or plea bargain is made or accepted on behalf of multiple clients, the lawyer must inform each of them about all the material terms of the settlement, including what the other clients will receive or pay if the settlement or plea offer is accepted. See also Rule 1.0(e) (definition of informed consent). Lawyers representing a class of plaintiffs or defendants, or those proceeding derivatively, may not have a full client-lawyer relationship with each member of the class; nevertheless, such lawyers must comply with applicable rules regulating notification of class members and other procedural requirements designed to ensure adequate protection of the entire class.


#### PROBLEM: Oops

__Problem 10-6__. We blew it. Don’t know how but we did. 
Martyn & Fox failed to file a client’s case within the appropriate statute of limitations. 
Must Martyn sit down with the client, confess her error, and offer to pay the entire amount of the underlying claims?

__Rules__: MR 1.8(h); RLGL §54

__Readings__: Bayview Loan Servicing (Chapter 5) (p. 134)

__Result__: Martyn should confess her error but should not attempt to settle the matter without advising client, in writing, of the desirability of seeking another lawyer’s advice.

__Reflections__: In Problem 5-2 and Bayview, we learned that Martyn & Fox must tell client about the error. This problem asks whether Martyn & Fox can go further and settle the matter. 

There is, of course, no requirement that any lawyer pay immediately “the entire amount of the underlying claim.” This reflects one difference between a concession (or a finding) of a violation of the rules of professional conduct and a claim for malpractice. 

The professional conduct violation may establish a violation of the standard of care (either directly or through the testimony of an expert), but it does not prove the client is entitled to everything the client sought in the underlying lawsuit. The lawyer is entitled to argue and defend the malpractice claim against her on the ground that, if the case had gone to trial, the client would have lost or have received significantly less in damages than the complaint originally sought, or would never have been able to collect a judgment. Thus, there is no obligation for the lawyer to simply write a check.

On the other hand, Martyn is in no position to evaluate the strength of the claim with the client’s interest in mind. This is why she should abide by MR 1.8(h), advise the client of the value of independent counsel, and settle only after such counsel has been obtained.

__References__: <br/>
__Discipline__: In re Greenlee, 143 P.3d 807 (Wash. 2006) (lawyer who instructed client to sign document waiving any malpractice claims suspended for six months; fact that no malpractice claim was ever raised or established irrelevant); In re Mizel, 703 A.2d 1249 (D.C. App. 1997) (lawyer who attempted to settle claims after he failed to file within the statute of limitations without advising client to seek independent counsel suspended for 90 days); In re Blackwelder, 615 N.E.2d 106 (Ind. 1993) (lawyer who missed the filing date for a client’s appeal and attempted to settle claim without advice to seek independent counsel publicly reprimanded).
__Validity of Settlement Agreement__: Swift v. Choe, 674 N.Y.S.2d 17 (App. Div. 1998) (advance release in real estate transaction invalid where lawyer failed to explain it to client with a vision problem); Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Strain, 432 N.W.2d 259 (S.D. 1988) (release obtained in settlement of malpractice action void where lawyer failed to disclose dealing with opposing party); Donnelly v. Ayer, 228 Cal. Rptr. 764 (Cal. App. 1986) (release valid where lawyer informed former client in writing to seek new counsel and client consulted other lawyers before signing release).


#### 1.8(h) Limitation of Liability to Client 

>__(h)__ A lawyer shall not: <br />
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(1)__ make an agreement prospectively limiting the lawyer's liability to a client for malpractice unless the client is independently represented in making the agreement; or <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(2)__ settle a claim or potential claim for such liability with an unrepresented client or former client unless that person is advised in writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel in connection therewith.

__Plain English__: A Lawyer SHALL NOT (1) make an agreement limiting future malpractice liability UNLESS client is independently represented, OR (2) settle a malpractice claim with an unrepresented client or former client UNLESS client is advised in writing to seek advice of independent legal counsel . . .

#### PROBLEM: The Mortgage

__Problem 10-7__. Client tells Martyn & Fox that he is strapped for cash and cannot afford our requested retainer in a divorce case. Martyn & Fox, at Fox’s suggestion, has Client sign a promissory note secured by a mortgage on the family home in lieu of the retainer.

__Rules__: MR 1.8(i); RLGL §36

__Readings__: None

__Result__: No.

__Reflections__: When a lawyer becomes a client’s creditor, all of the issues presented by MR 1.8(a) in doing business with a client are raised. Is the transaction entirely fair to the client? Is asking for a mortgage of the house overreaching? Is the rate of interest reasonable? Is the arrangement in writing? Has the client been advised to seek other counsel with respect to the loan? Will the transaction create a conflict for the lawyer? 

How does this differ from a contingent fee? 

When a lawyer takes a direct proprietary interest in the subject matter of the representation, this kind of conflict becomes nonconsentable under MR 1.8(i). 

This problem highlights the trap created for lawyers between their desire to “help out” an impecunious client (a situation guaranteed to arise in our students’ careers if they go into private practice) and their desire to avoid ethical pitfalls. The key here is distinguishing between an ownership/proprietary interest, which creates a nonconsentable conflict, and a business deal, such as a contingent fee or lien, which is allowed with appropriate consent.

#### 1.8(i). Proprietary Interest In Litigation

>__Rule 1.8(i). Proprietary Interest In Litigation__ <br />
>A lawyer shall not acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of litigation the lawyer is conducting for a client, except that the lawyer may: <br />
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(1)__ acquire a lien authorized by law to secure the lawyer's fee or expenses; and <br />
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(2)__ contract with a client for a reasonable contingent fee in a civil case.

This is what Monco did.

<!-- I don't know where to put this statement -->

>__Rule 1.8, Comment 16: Acquiring Proprietary Interest in Litigation__. <br />
>Paragraph (i) states the traditional general rule that lawyers are prohibited from acquiring a proprietary interest in litigation. Like paragraph (e), the general rule has its basis in common law champerty and maintenance and is designed to avoid giving the lawyer too great an interest in the representation. In addition, when the lawyer acquires an ownership interest in the subject of the representation, IT WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR A CLIENT TO DISCHARGE THE LAWYER IF THE CLIENT SO DESIRES. The Rule is subject to specific exceptions developed in decisional law and continued in these Rules. The exception for certain advances of the costs of litigation is set forth in paragraph (e). In addition, paragraph (i) sets forth exceptions for liens authorized by law to secure the lawyer's fees or expenses and contracts for reasonable contingent fees. The law of each jurisdiction determines which liens are authorized by law. These may include liens granted by statute, liens originating in common law and liens acquired by contract with the client. When a lawyer acquires by contract a security interest in property other than that recovered through the lawyer's efforts in the litigation, such an acquisition is a business or financial transaction with a client and is governed by the requirements of paragraph (a). Contracts for contingent fees in civil cases are governed by Rule 1.5.

a proceeding, illegal in many jurisdictions, by which a person not a party in a suit bargains to aid in or carry on its prosecution or defense by furnishing money or personal services in consideration of his receiving a share of the matter in suit . . .

:maintenance with the addition of an agreement to divide the thing in suit

#### Alternative Litigation Finance (ALF)

__1.8(a)__ doing business with client . . .
__1.8(e)__ providing financial assistance to a client . . .
__1.8(f)__ no interference . . .
__5.4(c)__ same . . .
__1.8(i)__ acquiring a proprietary interest in the litigation . . .
__1.16__ terminating the lawyer-client relationship . . .

Many provisions in the Model Rules of Professional Conduct regulate the conflicts of interest that may be created or exacerbated by the presence of ALF. In addition to the general material-limitation conflicts rule (Model Rule 1.7(a)(2)), and the regulation of business transactions with clients (Model Rule 1.8(a)), two non-waivable conflicts rules prohibit a lawyer from providing financial assistance to a client (Model Rule 1.8(e)) and acquiring a proprietary interest in the client’s cause of action (Model Rule 1.8(i)). Although it is not denominated a conflicts rule, the principles governing withdrawal from representation require that a client be free to terminate the representation without restriction. An agreement between an ALF supplier and a client, permitting the ALF supplier to have veto power over the selection of counsel, may limit the client’s right to terminate counsel in a manner that is inconsistent with Model Rule 1.16(a). Finally, a separate rule governs the provision of evaluations to someone other than the client.50 

#### 1.8(i). Proprietary Interest In Litigation

A lawyer conducting patent litigation for a client may not become part owner of the patent.

<!-- I do not know where this statement is located. -->

Lawyers may not acquire a proprietary interest in the subject matter of a client's litigation. See Model Rule 1.8(i); DR 5-103(A).

_In re Shaw_, 443 A.2d 670 (N.J. 1982) (lawyer “purchased” client's personal injury case); _cf. Lee v. Gadasa Corp._, 714 So. 2d 610, 14 Law. Man. Prof. Conduct 353 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1998) (lawyer not disqualified for taking security interest in client's property that was subject of foreclosure proceedings, where client waived any conflict and opponent delayed in bringing disqualification motion).

Both the ABA and Model Rules recognize that a lawyer may acquire a financial interest in the subject of litigation to SECURE FEES AND COSTS. Also, a lawyer may charge contingent fee and enforce an attorney’s lien.

#### PROBLEM: Did you hear . . . ?

__Problem 10-8__. Martyn & Fox represents Big Bank in a wide variety of matters. 
A colleague tells Fox at lunch: “Did you hear the latest? Sarah Snyder [an associate at Martyn & Fox] is dating the General Counsel of Big Bank. 
How’s that for cementing our relationship?”

__Rules__: MR 1.8(j); Cal. Rule 3-120; N.Y. DR 5-111

__Readings__: Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board v. Monroe 

__Result__: Depends what “dating” means, and who the client is.

__Reflections__: At first blush this particular problem might seem to describe a totally benign relationship between a female lawyer and a male client, unlike the more typically imagined situation of a vulnerable client in Monroe. 

The problem does not tell us whether the relationship is sexual, an issue that could be the launch pad for a discussion about whether a rule proscribing such activity requires a definition of what is actually prohibited. This topic has often produced animated debate and has led some jurisdictions to attempt definitions.

Sex with clients has been a front-burner issue for at least a decade. The most celebrated examples of abuse have arisen in the matrimonial area where lawyers like Monroe have in fact been charged with misconduct vis-à-vis clients who, by virtue of their legal troubles, are rendered even more vulnerable. Monroe also illustrates a disciplinary case where a court had no trouble finding a violation of Rule 1.8(j), now adopted by most jurisdictions. 

Some jurisdictions, notably New York, have adopted Rules of Professional Conduct directed at that one situation. Others have applied general ethical rules (such as 1.4, 1.7 and 2.1) to impose discipline. (See Halverson below). 

When the ABA Ethics Committee was originally asked to proscribe sex with clients by adopting a rule, the idea was rejected and instead ABA Formal Op. 92-364 was issued, warning lawyers of the multiple ethical issues raised by such activity. 

Monroe construes the one exception to Rule 1.8(j), – sexual relationships between client and lawyer that precede the client-lawyer relationship. Withdrawing from a case does not legitimate a pre-existing sexual relationship that began while the lawyer represented the client. Monroe also helps explain the need for an absolute prohibition: lawyers like Monroe should not assume that “mutual agreement” when a client relies on a lawyer for legal services can ever be completely consensual. Other professional groups, especially mental health and counseling professionals, include the reality of psychological transference in their training and practice. Literally, transference means that a person unconsciously transfers feelings and wishes about someone to another person. This commonly occurs in trusting relationships where confidential information is shared. The knowledge, expertise and power of the professional combined with the client’s need make transference especially likely and render any client-initiated sexual overtures suspect. This explains why the ethics codes of counselors absolutely prohibit sexual relationships with clients, and often extend the prohibition for years beyond the treatment period.

Yet, the facts in this problem might convince some that maybe there should have been a second exception to the ABA rule. In fact, some jurisdictions so not extend it to entity clients. If students want to pursue this line of reasoning, the problem might be amended to indicate that the client is putting pressure on the lawyer to approve nondisclosure of some off-balance sheet transactions, using their personal relationship as a lever to compromise the lawyer’s professional independence. 

If Martyn & Fox’s associate, Sarah, is sexually involved with the bank’s general counsel, Comment [19] to MR 1.8 follows the general rule, which extends the prohibition to constituents of client organizations who supervise or regularly consult with the lawyer. But this conflict, unlike the others in Rule 1.8, is personal. Other lawyers at Martyn & Fox can represent Big Bank if Sarah wishes to stay sexually involved.

Rule 1.8 comment [19] When the client is an organization, paragraph (j) of this Rule prohibits a lawyer for the organization (whether inside counsel or outside counsel) from having a sexual relationship with a constituent of the organization who supervises, directs or regularly consults with that lawyer concerning the organization's legal matters.


You might want to conclude the discussion by asking what remedies the bank could seek if Sarah is sexually involved with the bank’s counsel. The courts recognize three: criminal accountability for egregious conduct, civil liability where harm is caused, and professional discipline, as in Monroe.

#### PROBLEM: Pillow Talk?

__Problem 10-9__. Martyn & Fox represents Acme Corp. in contested litigation against Zenon Inc. 
Our senior associate wants to assume a major role in the case even though he is married to the lead lawyer for Zenon. He says it’ll be a great challenge.

__Rules__: MR 1.7, 1.10(a). 
 
__Readings__: None

__Result__: Yes, but only if both clients give informed consent.

__Reflections__: Former MR 1.8(i), specifically addressed the situation outlined in this problem. It has been removed from 1.8 and replaced with the general conflicts provision in 1.7, because it was both under- and over-inclusive. Some relationships not governed by the old rule (e.g., roommates) might prove just as powerful an influence on a lawyer as a family tie. On the other hand, even a spousal tie may mean little if the spouse’s role is minimal. Cal. Rule 3-320 is more definitive, but may present some of the same issues:

    A member shall not represent a client in a matter in which another party’s lawyer is a spouse, parent, child, or sibling of the member, lives with the member, is a client of the member, or has an intimate personal relationship with the member, unless the member informs the client in writing or the relationship.

This is the place to examine the way MR 1.7 works with personal interest conflicts, and the way MR 1.10(a) excludes some conflicts from imputation to the law firm. You can use this opportunity to discuss the concept of imputation and how far it should extend. Role-playing discussions between lawyer and client regarding waiver of a conflict of interest is always an instructive exercise, demonstrating vividly for the students how awkward these discussions may be. Now that MR 1.7 requires that waivers should be reflected in a writing, it might also be instructive to discuss what disclosures should be included in that letter.

#### Model Rule 1.7 Comment [11]

__Model Rule 1.7 Comment [11]. Personal Interest Conflicts__

[11] When lawyers representing different clients in the same matter or in substantially related matters are closely related by blood or marriage, there may be a significant risk that client confidences will be revealed and that the lawyer's family relationship will interfere with both loyalty and independent professional judgment. As a result, each client is entitled to know of the existence and implications of the relationship between the lawyers before the lawyer agrees to undertake the representation. __Thus, a lawyer related to another lawyer, e.g., as parent, child, sibling or spouse, ordinarily may not represent a client in a matter where that lawyer is representing another party, unless each client gives informed consent.__ The disqualification arising from a close family relationship is personal and ordinarily is not imputed to members of firms with whom the lawyers are associated. See Rule 1.10.

### 3. Significant Lawyer Personal Interests

#### Legal Tender: It Wasn’t The Money

Lawyers serving on the boards of their clients.

(Like “The Opinion Letter” p. 215 which illustrated the painful interaction between Rule 4.1 (truthfulness in statements to others) specifically 4.1(b) “A lawyer shall not fail to disclose a material fact when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client, UNLESS DISCLOSURE IS PROHIBITED BY RULE 1.6.” 

Another long-winded Fox tale, but illustrates another common lawyer problem. Lawyers serving on Boards of Directors. Ed Frazer serves as CEO of Hanscom Industries. Peter is managing Partner at Caldwell & Moore. Now Hanscom wants to sell limited partnership interests in various resort hotels.

US attorney investigating MAI appraisal Co, which had appraised Hanscom’s resort properties. Well, we’ve uncovered substantial evidence that MAI received bribes from Hanscom’s CFO George Sandel.

Lawyer Peter: “Next payments from the limited partners are due on June 1. We have to tell them about this before that date. The prospectus omits a material fact. And my firm Caldwell and Moore drafted that prospectus.”

Not only that, the partners and Peter have personally invested in the resort deals. Now Peter is torn between Ed and his firm, which will be co-defendants in a Rule 10-b-5 action. So Peter is director of Hanscom and must act in the best interests of Hanscom, but he’s also managing partner of Caldwell and More, which is looking at liability. So Peter goes back to Caldwell and Moore and talks to his old trusted Mentor Harry Gill. Harry is saddened and says he can’t give Peter advice. Peter needs to get his own lawyer. 

__Problem 8-2[?]__. Should Martyn agree to accept one third of the shares of stock issued in a new business start-up in lieu of an hourly fee? Should she agree to serve on the new company’s board of directors?

__Rules__: MR 1.7, 1.8(a), 1.8(k); RLGL §126

__Readings__: Monco v. Janus, “It Wasn’t the Money”

__Result__: Depends on the client’s need and our compliance with very stringent conflicts rules.

__Reflections__: Students’ perspective on this particular problem has changed dramatically since we have seen the dot-com bubble burst. But those effects do not mean that lawyers will not in the future, as they have for generations, either be asked by the clients or desire themselves to get a piece of the action in lieu of a cash fee.

This problem gives the class an opportunity to explore several important concerns. ABA Formal Op. 00-418 systematically addresses issues raised by lawyers investing in their clients’ businesses. ABA Formal Op. 00-416 reaches similar conclusions about the impact of 1.8(a) when a lawyer purchases accounts receivable from a client, and ABA Formal Op. 02-427 applies MR 1.8(a) to contractual security interests that a lawyer obtains to secure a fee.

When the lawyer takes shares in lieu of cash, the first issue is whether the lawyer is now doing business with the client and, therefore, has to conform her conduct to Rule 1.8(a). 

Here, we introduce MR 1.7 and explain how this general conflicts rule developed into a more specific rule as lawyers like Monco continued to misunderstand the exact nature of their fiduciary responsibility. Second, MR 1.8(a) directs the lawyer’s attention to whether and how the lawyer’s independence might be compromised in terms of providing the client objective advice when the only way the lawyer gets paid is if stock is, in fact, issued. Here we find it helpful to ask students precisely what Monco did wrong. Third, there are significant liability concerns raised by a payment of this type. If, in fact, the stock subsequently falters, the lawyer who received stock on the public offering is far more likely to be named a defendant than if the lawyer had simply been paid a fee. In addition, the argument that the lawyer was a principal, not just an aider or abettor of the fraudulent conduct, is more likely to prevail in this connection. Monco introduces another remedy: a constructive trust, which served to undo the deal the lawyer thought he had made. 

The second portion of this problem answers the question of whether a lawyer should agree to sit on the board of directors of a client company.  ”It Wasn’t the Money” illustrates the truth that lawyers are flattered by such requests and view these opportunities as providing them with an effective means of cementing the lawyer-client relationship.  Lawyers also will like very much the fees to which they might become entitled, as well as rubbing elbows with the great and near great who serve on the board.

Notwithstanding all those desirable effects, real ethical problems can arise.  First, the lawyer must worry about which hat the lawyer is wearing at any given time.  Could the lawyer, as a lawyer, be required to give advice that is different from the advice the lawyer might give in the role as director?  Second, there is the difficulty of determining whether the lawyer’s advice will be subject to the privilege.  In a world where privilege is constantly under attack, the wearing of two hats will be used by those who wish to tear down the privilege.  “She was acting as a director, and there is no director-company privilege.”  Third, the relationship between the client and the director’s law firm will be subject to allegations of self-dealing and intense scrutiny of the legal fees as would any transaction between the company and an entity owned by a director.  Fourth, just when the director’s law firm might be most needed by the company – a major crisis or critical litigation – the law firm may be conflicted out because the law firm is either a co-defendant or the law firm’s advice is particularly subject to challenge.  Fifth, though there is no empirical data to prove the point, it is received wisdom that the likelihood of the law firm being sued in connection with its work for a company increases if a lawyer from that firm sits on the board.

We like to encourage our students to serve on boards of directors when they become lawyers.  We like to think that lawyers make terrific board members.  Our advice here is simply not to become a director of an organization that is a client of the firm. One exception might be some non-profits, some of which may not be able to survive without a lawyer’s pro bono service as both lawyer and director.

## PROBLEM: Movie Rights

__Problem 10-3__. The client’s story is in every newspaper. Front page. But the client is broke. 
Should Martyn & Fox provide free legal services to this criminal defendant in return for the movie rights to his story?

__Rules__: MR 1.8(d); RLGL §36

__Readings__: None

__Result__: No.

__Reflections__: This problem directly addresses the prohibition in MR 1.8(d), which provides that it is unethical for a lawyer to enter into an agreement of this type prior to the conclusion of the representation, even if such an arrangement may provide the client with the benefit of free legal services. 

The class should explore the public policy behind this prohibition, which is designed to avoid the lawyer having an interest in the matter in terms of creating the greatest value for the screen rights, when the client’s interest could well be a result that leaves the media totally indifferent. 

Again, the class should be reminded that such an arrangement also implicates MR 1.8(a), in that the lawyer probably would be deemed to be doing business with the client under these circumstances.

For an example of the evil that this rule addresses, you might want to recall the case of Betty Lou Beets, whose lawyer had her sign such an agreement after he had already given her the advice to seek life insurance payments following the “disappearance” of her husband. This advice later became the basis for the death penalty specification when Ms. Beets was charged with murdering her husband. At trial, it became clear that her lawyer could take the stand to save her life, but the lawyer did not want to forego the publication rights he might lose if disqualified as counsel when he testified. As a result, Ms. Beets got the death penalty and has been executed, while her lawyer, who had other ambitions, now is in jail for bribery.

#### 1.8(d): Literary Rights

>__Rule 1.8(d)__
>
>Prior to the conclusion of representation of a client, a lawyer shall not make or negotiate an agreement giving the lawyer literary or media rights to a portrayal or account based in substantial part on information relating to the representation.

__Plain English__: Prior to conclusion of representation, lawyer shall not make or bargain for literary or media rights based on representation.

What is the real problem here? Conflict between what makes the best book or movie deal vs. what is the best for the client? The best entertainment properties tend to be about guilty people who get off (O.J.) or innocent people who go to jail. So do we really want a trial lawyer who sees herself as the hero of this trial faced with a pretty good settlement offer? Or faced with the knowledge that good trial movies don’t typically end in confidential settlement agreements.

#### Reversal of Fortune

#### PROBLEM: [. . .]

__Problem 10-4__. The offer is ridiculous. But our client, in order to survive financially, thinks she must settle her case now. 
Should Martyn & Fox pay her living expenses through trial?

__Rules__: MR 1.8(e); Cal. Rule 4-210(A)(2), DC Rule 1.8(d); RLGL §36

__Result__: No.

__Reflections__: This problem addresses another part of the nagging issue presented when a lawyer enters into a relationship with the client other than the professional one. All this is part of a more general provision in MR 1.8(i), which prohibits lawyers from acquiring a proprietary interest in the litigation, subject to certain exceptions, such as contingent fees and, as here, court costs.

Lawyers who take matters on a contingent basis will invariably advance the costs and disbursements of the matter. Though the client is technically responsible for reimbursing these advances, in a case with no recovery, lawyers are free to forgive such a debt rather than seek repayment, and either practice is indeed ethical. Living costs are another matter. Most jurisdictions do not permit such advances. MR 1.8(e); RLGL §36. The theory is that the lawyer’s interest in being repaid significant nonlitigation-related advances might create a conflict with what is in the best interests of the client. 

The class might want to explore whether the distinction between advances for litigation costs and advances for living expenses is a principled one. A few jurisdictions such as California and the District of Columbia Rule 1.8(d)(2) permit advancing these expenses and apparently have had no trouble with an alternative position. Both rules hinge on prior employment of the lawyer, which presumably restricts that lawyer’s ability to advertise the practice.

For a discussion of the advisability of these alternatives, see, James E. Moliterno, Broad Prohibition, Thin Rationale: The Acquisition of an Interest and Financial Assistance in Litigation Rules, 16 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 223 (2003).

On the other hand, if the lawyer advances living expenses and charges interest, that agreement would violate not only MR 1.8(e), but also would be subject to MR 1.8(a)’s requirements on doing business with clients. You might ask the class whether the lawyer should charge 17.9%, a little less than the client would have to pay if she put the living expenses on her credit card.

Students may want to consider here the conflict that develops between client and contingent-fee lawyers over settlement offers. Often the client, anxious to cover living expenses, will be interested in accepting a settlement offer that appears outsized in relation to the client’s station in life, but, in the view of the lawyer, is far too low for the injuries sustained. Alternatively, the client may have a far too grandiose view of how the client will get rich quick through taking the case to trial, while the lawyer views a settlement offer as fair, given the real risks of pressing the case through to final verdict and appeal. The client, as we know, gets the final say, but the lawyer has significant persuasive opportunities and power over the client. When is the client getting advice that is in the client’s best interest and when is the client being pressured to accept a settlement because the lawyer has a different agenda? Here, even though contingent fees and litigation expense advancements are allowed, the conflicts that surround actual settlements continue to be governed by MR 1.7, which requires a lawyer to disclose her adverse interests.

Some students may assume that lawyers press clients not to settle so that the lawyers have a chance at a big payday. In fact, plaintiffs’ lawyers tell us the reverse is true: The lawyer, more often than not, recommends settlement and the client balks at accepting “too little.” An excellent videotape produced by the University of Pennsylvania Law School Center on Professional Responsibility features a conversation between Gerry Litvin, one of Philadelphia’s most outstanding plaintiffs’ lawyers, and a hapless client regarding a settlement offer the client wants to accept but Litvin believes is inadequate; this would provide an excellent class discussion.

Conflicts of Interest

Lawyer May Pay Travel Expenses
For Indigent Client to Attend Court

BNA Snapshot
Rhode Island Ethics Op. 2012-08 (10/11/12)
Key Guidance: A lawyer may reimburse an indigent out-of-state client for her travel costs to attend court hearings.

Significance: Emphasizes that rule restricting financial assistance to clients mustn't be read in way that denies access to courts for low-income clients.

By Joan C. Rogers
A lawyer representing an indigent client in family law matters in Rhode Island may pay the client's costs to travel from out of state to attend court hearings, the Rhode Island Supreme Court's ethics panel advised Oct. 11 (Rhode Island Supreme Court Ethics Advisory Panel, Op. 2012-08, 10/11/12).

These costs may be paid without any expectation of reimbursement in order to ensure access to the courts, the panel concluded. Such payments will not violate the disciplinary rule that prohibits lawyers' financial assistance to clients in most circumstances, it added.

Client Moved Away

The lawyer who sought the panel's advice represents a client in a divorce case and a matter in family court. The client has moved to the Midwest to live with her parents. Her financial situation is dire, and she cannot afford transportation costs to attend court dates in Rhode Island. The lawyer is willing to reimburse the client for most of her transportation costs if that is ethically permissible.

Rhode Island Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(e) is identical to its counterpart in the Model Rules. It prohibits lawyers from providing financial assistance to clients in connection with litigation, except that:

• court costs and litigation expenses may be advanced to clients with repayment contingent on the outcome of the litigation, and
• court costs and litigation expenses may be paid on behalf of indigent clients.

Access to Justice
The panel pointed out that access to justice is mentioned in Comment [10] to Rule 1.8 as part of the rationale for allowing lawyers to lend clients court costs and litigation expenses. The comment also declares that an exception permitting lawyers to pay court costs and litigation expenses of indigent clients is warranted, whether or not these expenditures are repaid.

Building on those comments, the panel found that “an indigent client who cannot afford transportation to the courthouse is effectively denied access to the courts.”
“[A]n indigent client who cannot afford transportation to the courthouse is effectively denied access to the courts.”

Rhode Island Ethics Op. 2012-08

Accordingly, “if the out of state client is indigent and is unable to afford transportation costs to attend court hearings…, the inquiring attorney may pay the client's transportation costs in order to ensure access to the courts, regardless of whether those costs will be repaid,” the panel advised.

As support for its conclusion, the panel cited Connecticut Informal Ethics Op. 00-21 (2000), which advised that a lawyer may pay for a low-income out-of-state client's travel to and lodging in Connecticut for a deposition in the client's personal injury case.

#### Rule 1.8(f) 

>__Rule 1.8(f)__ 
>
>A lawyer shall not accept compensation for representing a client from one other than the client unless: <br/>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(1)__ the client gives informed consent; <br/>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(2)__ there is no interference with the lawyer's independence of professional judgment or with the client-lawyer relationship; and <br/>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(3)__ information relating to representation of a client is protected as required by Rule 1.6.

__Plain English__: Lawyer shall NOT accept money from third person UNLESS:

* Client gives informed consent;
* No interference!
* Info kept confidential!

#### Example 

Let’s begin with Dastardly Dan Defendant ("Dan"), who pays premiums to an insurance company. This is a CONTRACT, right? 

>I, Dan, promise to pay you, insurance company, the premiums on my car insurance policy, in case I have a car accident. If Pugnacious Plaintiff sues me and tries to say that I, Dastardly Dan Defendant, CAUSED the accident, then you insurance company promise to pay the CLAIM and/or hire a lawyer to defend me against pugnacious plaintiff’s claims.

Okay, is there an attorney-client relationship between Dastardly Dan Defendant and Lisa Lawyer? Yes. 

Does it include all of the duties and loyalty requirements of the model rules (1.6 confidentiality, 1.4 communication, 2.1 advice, LOYALTY the list goes on). Is Lisa Dan’s SUPER FIDUCIARY? Yes. Good!

Now what about between the Lawyer and the insurance company? Is there an attorney-client relationship between the lawyer and the insurance company? Does Lisa have one client, DAN? Or two clients? Dan and the Insurance company? It’s tricky right, because what happens if in the course of investigating the claim we discover evidence that amounts to a no-coverage defense?

#### Insurer Retains Lawyer  to Represent Insured

Restatement Third says _whether the lawyer has one client or two is a matter of insurance law_, not the law governing lawyers.

Still in dispute. Insurance companies like to argue that they too are clients.

Old way to treat the problem was to make it a multiple client problem, but makes the analysis confusing.

May lawyer write a report to the insurer if the insured objects under Rule 1.6 (confidentiality)? Normally only the client may tell the lawyer to settle. The insurer may say, “Settle!” The insured may say, “No way!”

Right to sue for malpractice. Some states say only a client may sue, whereas probably only the insurer really suffers the financial loss.

Either way, 1.8(f) (compensation from one other than the client) and 1.7(a)(current conflicts) apply.

Henderson may owe enforceable duties to the insurance company if it is not a client, and these concerns do not go away if the lawyer has two clients instead of one.

#### Iowa Disciplinary Board v. Monroe, (Iowa 2010)

Board filed charges against attorney William Monroe alleging that he engaged in a sexual relationship with a client in violation of the Iowa Rules of Professional Conduct.

Monroe’s client-lawyer relationship with Does commenced in the spring of 2007. He did not have sexual relations with her until late May 2007. Therefore the rule’s exception for sexual relationships that predate the client-lawyer relationship does not apply here.

Bottom of Page 372, “There are no gray areas!”

#### In re Halverson (WA 2000)

A ladies man, Don Juan, Lothario. What a doofus!

A FAMILY LAW man. He wrote a book telling other lawyers how dangerous it is to sleep with clients, and then slept with six of his own clients. 

<!-- Slide 97 contained a cartoon -->

#### "Body Heat"

See _Body Heat_, starring William Hurt, Kathleen Turner, Ted Danson and Mickey Rourke if you want a vivid illustration of how bad things can go wrong. Also, it’s the only movie I know of with a plot device featuring the Rule Against Perpetuities!

#### Intimate Relationships Between Lawyers and Clients

Aw, come on? Really?
Rule 1.8(j)
Loss of objectivity and emotional distance;
Conflicts of interest.
Confusion about confidentiality of communications.


Rule 1.8(j) deals only with “sexual relations” a term that was subject to a great deal of debate during the Clinton presidency. Notice that the Rule exempts consensual sexual relationships THAT ALREADY EXISTED when the client-lawyer relationship commenced.

Now, we talked about imputation of conflicts under 1.10.

DON’T DO THIS. Have your friend with benefits get another lawyer.

Note attorney case in Omaha where lawyer insinuated that he would forget about the bill in exchange for sexual favors. Busted!

#### Model Rule 1.8(j), Comment 17

>__Model Rule 1.8(j), Comment [17]: Client-Lawyer Sexual Relationships__ <br />
>The relationship between lawyer and client is a fiduciary one in which the lawyer occupies the highest position of trust and confidence. The relationship is almost always unequal; thus, a sexual relationship between lawyer and client can involve unfair exploitation of the lawyer's fiduciary role, in violation of the lawyer's basic ethical obligation not to use the trust of the client to the client's disadvantage. In addition, such a relationship presents a significant danger that, because of the lawyer's emotional involvement, the lawyer will be unable to represent the client without impairment of the exercise of independent professional judgment. Moreover, a blurred line between the professional and personal relationships may make it difficult to predict to what extent client confidences will be protected by the attorney-client evidentiary privilege, since client confidences are protected by privilege only when they are imparted in the context of the client-lawyer relationship. Because of the significant danger of harm to client interests and because the client's own emotional involvement renders it unlikely that the client could give adequate informed consent, __this Rule prohibits__ the lawyer from having __sexual relations with a client regardless of whether the relationship is consensual and regardless of the absence of prejudice to the client.__

Typical of the specific prohibitions under 1.8. The ABA doesn’t care if there’s no prejudice, if the client is happy, if the relationship is consensual, it’s STILL PROHIBITED. Why? (see red below)

#### Model Rule 1.8(k)

>__Rule 1.8(k)__<br/> 
>While lawyers are associated in a firm, a prohibition in the foregoing paragraphs (a) through (i) that applies to any one of them shall apply to all of them.

>__Rule 1.8, Comment [20]: Imputation of Prohibitions__ <br/>
>Under paragraph (k), a prohibition on conduct by an individual lawyer in paragraphs (a) through (i) also applies to all lawyers associated in a firm with the personally prohibited lawyer. For example, one lawyer in a firm may not enter into a business transaction with a client of another member of the firm without complying with paragraph (a), even if the first lawyer is not personally involved in the representation of the client. The prohibition set forth in paragraph (j) is personal and is not applied to associated lawyers.

#### Rule 1.10(a): Imputation 

>__Rule 1.10. Imputation Of Conflicts Of Interest: General Rule__<br/>
>__(a)__ While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7 or 1.9, unless <br/>

## C. Client and Third-Person Interests

### PROBLEM: Insurance

__Problem 10-11(a)__. Martyn & Fox is hired by Insurance Company to represent several of its insureds. Who is our client?

__Rules__: MR 1.7, 1.8(f); RLGL §14

__Readings__: Paradigm Insurance Co. v. The Langerman Law Offices, P.A.; Lawyers and Clients: Insurance Defense

__Result__: All courts agree the insureds are Martyn & Fox’s clients. Courts are split on the status of insurer.

__Reflections__: This problem opens up a can of worms – the triangular relationship among insured, insurer, and the lawyer hired by the latter to represent the former. The first issue is whether the lawyer has one or two clients. Paradigm illustrates how jurisdictions are split on this point of law, but the students, now that they have thought about other joint representations, might want to explore why the insurance company would want to be considered a client and whether the lawyer, if given a choice, would prefer to have two clients or one. You might consider at least five reasons:

1.  Who can sue for incompetence? Paradigm indicates that, at least where the harm was caused to the insurer but not the insured, the insurer need not be a client to seek malpractice relief. Some jurisdictions invoke the equitable subrogation doctrine to reach the same result. Others allow the insurer to sue only if properly a second client of the lawyer, which requires adequate attention to waivers of conflicts of interest by the insured. Pine Island Farmers Coop v. Erstad & Riemer, P.A., 649 N.W.2d 444 (Minn. 2002). Similar issues occur when the insured sues both the lawyer for malpractice and claims vicarious liability against the insurer. In St. Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Traver, 980 S.W.2d 625 (Tex. 1998) the court found no vicarious liability due to a lack of ability to control the details of the lawyer’s conduct. 

2.  Who can invoke and waive the attorney-client and work-product privilege? If both are clients, the co-client privilege (RLGL §75) protects matters of common interest against third persons, but not between the co-clients. Note 3 in Paradigm points to the same result even if the insurer is not a client because the insurer acts as agent of the insured for purposes of preparing the defense. 

3.  Can insurers hire inside counsel to represent insureds? In Petition of Youngblood, 895 S.W.2d 322 (Tenn. 1995) the court allowed such a practice, and in Am. Ins. Assn. v. Ky. Bar Assn., 917 S.W.2d 568 (Ky. 1996) the Kentucky Supreme Court prohibited it.

4.  Control over fees and strategy, discussed in Part (b) below.

5.  Control over other fiduciary duties such as confidentiality and loyalty, discussed in Parts (c), (d), and (e) below.

Regardless of whether the insurance company is a client, there is no doubt that the insured is the primary client. But in the “real world” the insurance company will test the principle in MR 1.8(f) that a third-party payer shall not interfere with the lawyer’s professional independence. 

__References__: <br/>
__Discipline__: Amendment to Rules Regulating the Florida Bar Regarding Rules of Professional Conduct, 838 So. 2d 1140 (Fla. 2003) (adopted new Rule of Prof. Conduct 4-1.7(e), requiring lawyers to ascertain whom the lawyer represents in insurance defense, and 4-7.10, which governs the firm names of insurance staff lawyers).
__Malpractice__: St. and County Mutual Ins. Co. v. Young, 490 F. Supp.2d 741 (N.D. W. Va. 2007) (although insured and not insurer is the client, insurer may bring malpractice suit against lawyer retained to defend insured to the extent that the insurer is directly concerned in the matter financially; lawyer’s failure to respond to discovery and motions, which forced insurer to settle the underlying claims for excessive amount, states cause of action).
__Attorney-Client Privilege__: Palmer by Diacon v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 861 P.2d 895 (Mont. 1993), held that in bad faith cases, the insured is entitled to the entire claim file. In a bad faith action where the insurer denied all coverage, however, the court held the lawyers represented only the insurer and, therefore, the files were privileged against the insured. 
__Litigation Misconduct__: Givens v. Mullikin, 75 S.W.3d 383 (Tenn. 2002) (insurer may be vicariously liable for abuse of process by independent contractor defense counsel it selected where insurer knowingly authorized or directed the acts in question).
__Discipline__: Am. Ins. Assn., discussed in point 3 above, held that a lawyer who agreed to do all of an insurer’s defense work for a set fee would be subject to discipline for violating MR 1.7(b) and 1.8(f).
__Disqualification__: Nev. Yellow Cab Corp. v. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 152 P.3d 737 (Nev. 2007) (Counsel retained by an insurer to represent its insured represented both the insurer and the insured in the absence of a conflict, and an attorney-client relationship existed between the insurer and the associate who had previously defended the insured. Associate’s new firm is disqualified from suung the insurer for bad faith).


__Problem 10-11(b)__. Martyn & Fox is hired by Insurance Company to represent several of its insureds. Can Insurance Company tell Martyn & Fox: how many depositions to take? Whether and when to hire an expert witness? What motions to file? To send bills to an outside auditing company for review?


__Rules__: MR 1.8(f), 5.4(c); RLGL §134 Ill. 5

__Readings__: Lawyers and Clients: Insurance Defense

__Result__: No, although Martyn & Fox may “consult” on the matter. 

__Reflections__: The problem’s proposed restrictions on lawyer action provide a matrix for evaluating how far the insurance company can control lawyer judgment. The client, insured, has no incentive to seek anything other than a Cadillac (or Lexus) defense. The insurance company, which tends to look at these matters on a macro basis, includes defense costs among its highest costs of doing business. 

Attempts by the insurance company to limit its obligations to its insured and control these matters will be found in the insurance policy the policyholder received at the commencement of coverage and never read. The ethical principles of the profession, however, are evaluated and enforced based on principles of full disclosure and understanding at the time the conduct occurs, thus creating a classic clash.

The billing audit is just one example of the guerilla war between insurance companies and defense counsel, with insurance companies insisting on these audits where decisions about staffing, motion practice, and the need for expert witnesses can get second-guessed, generally by nonlawyers. The guerilla war has led to literally dozens of bar association opinions discussed in ABA Formal Opinion 01-421. 
 
We based this problem on In re Rules of Professional Conduct, 2 P.3d 806 (Mont. 2000), which condemned insurance company interference with retained counsel. Rules held that lawyers who agree to this kind of interference by contract or in practice are subject to discipline, and that an insured client’s informed consent is required before bills can be sent to outside auditors (who are paid on a contingent fee basis by insurers). 

RLGL §134(2) allows outside direction that is reasonable in scope, as long as it does not create interference with the lawyer’s professional judgment and the client consents. Illustration 5 indicates that if Martyn & Fox reasonably believe that forgoing a deposition, motion, or an expert will not violate their duty of competent representation, they may comply, as long as the insured consents. Hazard & Hodes, The Law of Lawyering (3d ed., Aspen 2001) §12.15 provides additional discussion of this provision.

<!-- Did not include actual language from rule, but Presenter Notes includes entire rule -->

__Problem 10-11(c)__. Martyn & Fox is hired by Insurance Company to represent several of its insureds. In the course of investigating our first case, Fox comes across a confidential medical file that shows the insured was told by his physician to stop driving because of his Parkinson’s disease. The insured’s policy includes standard language that excludes coverage for drivers with certain medical conditions. What should Fox do with this information?

__Rules__: MR 1.6, 1.7, 1.8(f)

__Readings__: Paradigm Insurance Co. v. The Langerman Law Offices, P.A. 

__Result__: Fox must not use or disclose this information to the detriment of the insured. 

__Reflections__: In jurisdictions like Arizona, the insurance company at least initially is and believes it should be treated as a client, which creates a problem when confidential information about policy coverage is shared with by the insured with his lawyer. In the insurer is a client, Rule 1.4 would seem to charge the lawyer with sharing the critical information regarding the insured’s health status. At the same time, Rule 1.6 protects the insured’s confidences. 

On facts like this, courts agree that the lawyer is barred from sharing the insured’s information with the insurance company on the theory that the insured has now become the “primary client” to whom the highest duties are owed.   This also has to be the right solution for the difficult situation presented when lawyer learns facts that would compromise coverage, because the insurance policy itself set up the conflict between coverage and its obligation to “defend” the insured by providing a lawyer, complete with the fiduciary duty of confidentiality.

In a jurisdiction where the lawyer represents two clients, you might want to refer to A. v. B. in the next chapter and Perez in Chapter 6 in answering this question. Recall that the lawyers in Perez were liable for breach of fiduciary duty for a mistake like this. In A. v. B., the court justified the disclosure on the basis of an explicit exception in the state version of MR 1.6. No such exception justifies disclosure here. 

MR 1.8(f) also makes clear that the lawyer who represents only the insured cannot share this information. In fact when the lawyer discovers facts suggesting that coverage is at issue, many courts require separate counsel for the insured. Some jurisdictions allow the insurer to bring a separate declaratory judgment action to determine the issue of coverage, but the insurer cannot use any information relating to the representation of the insured to raise or litigate the issue. 

Here, Fox will have to make clear to the insurer that it does not represent the insurer’s interests in the matter, but will not be able to disclose insured’s confidences to justify his decision. This is a good time to introduce students to the reservation of rights letter and to discuss how the lawyer hired by the insurance company, whether deemed to have two clients or one, will have to avoid becoming involved in any coverage issues between insurance company and insured and, at the same time, despite the insurance company’s demand for information in order to evaluate the case and the lawyer’s bills, protect the insured’s confidential information that might affect coverage questions. 

Fox will be subject to malpractice if the insured is injured by disclosure to the insurer, such as by losing an adequate defense, and insurer will be estopped to deny the policy coverage if this information is used to promote a policy defense before the underlying case is properly defended. Insurer also might be liable for bad faith if it refuses to settle the case thinking it has a policy defense, which could subject Fox to malpractice liability to the insurer.

__References__: <br/>
__Bad Faith__: We based this problem on Parsons v. Continental National American Group, 550 P.2d 94 (Ariz. 1976), where the court held that the insurer was estopped from denying coverage under its policy when its defense was based on confidential information obtained by the insured’s lawyer defending of the underlying tort action. The court further characterized the insurer’s refusal to settle within policy limits after they learned of the policy defense as bad faith, which resulted in an obligation to pay all of the underlying judgment, which was twice the policy limit. 
__Reservation of Rights__: For a case involving sexual misconduct by a physician where the court found that the lawyer offered a “splendid” defense under a reservation of rights. See, St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Engelmann, 639 N.W.2d 192 (S.D. 2000). But see, Beckwith Mach. Co. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 638 F. Supp. 1179 (W.D. Pa. 1986), where the failure to send a reservation of rights letter or file a declaratory judgment action estopped the insurer from denying coverage and created liability for bad faith and breach of contract.
__Declaratory Judgment Action__: Employers Cas. Co. v. Tilley, 496 S.W.2d 552 (Tex. 1973) (in a declaratory judgment action concerning whether insured failed to give timely notice of claim, insurer estopped to deny coverage because it attempted to use insured’s statements obtained by lawyer hired by insurer to defend insured).

> __RLGL §134, Comment f: Representing an insured__
> 
> __When there is a question whether a claim against the insured is within the coverage of the policy, a lawyer designated to defend the insured may not reveal adverse confidential client information of the insured to the insurer concerning that question__ (see § 60) without explicit informed consent of the insured (see § 62). __That follows whether or not the lawyer also represents the insurer as co-client__ and whether or not the insurer has asserted a "reservation of rights" with respect to its defense of the insured (compare § 60, Comment l (confidentiality in representation of co-clients in general)).

__Reservation of Rights.__ Notice from the insurer to the insured that coverage is at issue.

An insurer's notification to an insured that coverage for a claim may not apply. Such notification allows an insurer to investigate (or even defend) a claim to determine if coverage applies (in whole or in part) without waiving its right to later deny coverage based on information revealed by the investigation. Although a reservation of rights protects an insurer's interests, it also alerts an insured to the fact that some elements of a claim may not be covered, thereby allowing the insured to take necessary steps to protect its potentially uninsured interests.

__Problem 10-11(d)__. Martyn & Fox is hired by Insurance Company to represent several of its insureds. The plaintiff’s complaint in our second case demands $300,000 in damages resulting from an auto accident. Plaintiff offers to settle the case for the policy limits of $100,000, but Insurance Company tells Martyn, “We’d rather pay you to litigate this case than settle with that malingerer.” What should Martyn do?

__Rules__: MR 1.2(a), 1.8(f), 5.4(c)

__Readings__: Paradigm Insurance Co. v. The Langerman Law Offices, P.A.; Lawyers and Clients: Insurance Defense

__Result__: Martyn should carefully analyze the facts of the case and advise insurer that it may be subject to a bad faith refusal to settle claim.

__Reflections__: Conflicts of interest in insurance defense often arise from language in insurance policies. Typical insurance policies agree to “indemnify” for a given amount as well as to “defend” if the insured is sued in a covered matter. The duty to defend creates the right to a lawyer with ordinary fiduciary duties, such as the right to learn about the settlement offer and to decide whether to settle. At the same time, the insured agrees to “cooperate” in the defense of the case and cedes some measure of control over the matter to the insurer. Typical insurance policies may provide that the insurer has the right “to make such investigation, negotiation, and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient.” 

Policy language like this creates a conflict of interest when the insured has been sued for an amount in excess of policy limits and the insurer has some other reason to decline the settlement. At this point, the lawyer’s representation of the insured continues to be governed by the lawyer’s ethical obligations, and insurance law imposes an obligation on the insurer to act in good faith in responding to settlement offers. Failure to do so creates liability against the insurer for the entire judgment against insured, including sums in excess of policy limits. When a claim arises where there is a reasonable probability that the insured will be found liable for an excess judgment, the insurer must take the insured’s interests into account. ABA Formal Opinion 96-403 discusses these issues further.
The answer to our problem, therefore, depends upon the nature of the insured’s liability and the extent of damages in the matter. If liability is conceded and medical expenses alone reach the policy limits, failure to settle would constitute bad faith. On the other hand, if a lawyer representing the insured alone would advise litigating genuine issues of liability or damages, failure to settle within policy limits could be seen as objectively based on factors other than the conflict between insurer and insured. 

__References__: <br/>
__Bad Faith__: Behn v. Legion Ins. Co., 173 F. Supp.2d 105 (D. Mass. 2001) (insurer acted reasonably in refusing to settle medical malpractice case where expert witness opined that defendant psychiatrist complied with the standard of care, facts indicated comparative fault of plaintiff, and insured refused consent to settle); Haddick ex rel. Griffith v. Valor Ins., 763 N.E.2d 299 (Ill. 2001) (cause of action for bad faith refusal to settle found where liability conceded, medical expenses were in excess of policy limits, and insurer did not offer to settle for policy limits until one year after settlement demand initially made); Betts v.

App. 1984) (insurer and defense counsel jointly and severally liable for excess verdict, emotional distress, and punitive damages for failing to settle within policy limits where liability was clear).

Co., 78 P.3d 603 (Utah 2003) (lawyers who quit their jobs as in-house counsel for insurer claiming that insurer required them to violate ethical duties to insureds could disclose matters relating to their representation of the insurer as long as disclosures were reasonably necessary). 



__Problem 10-11(e)__. Martyn & Fox is hired by Insurance Company to represent several of its insureds.
In our third case, the insured is a physician accused of medical malpractice. Plaintiff offers to settle well within policy limits, and Insurance Company agrees, but the physician refuses, saying, “Settling this case will destroy my professional reputation.” What should Fox do?

__Rules__: MR 1.2(a), 1.7, 1.8(f), 5.4(c)

__Readings__: Paradigm Insurance Co. v. The Langerman Law Offices, P.A. 

__Result__: Fox should read the insurance policy, then tell physician that, absent a consent to settlement provision or bad faith, physician has no remedy if insurer settles, but physician does have the option of choosing to release insurer of its obligations under the policy and defending the action at physician’s own expense.

__Reflections__: Fox’s advice will depend upon the exact language in the insurance policy. If the policy requires the insured’s consent before settlement of the underlying matter (as it did in Behn cited in the last problem), then the settlement is invalid. On the other hand, if the policy specifically allows the insurer to settle without the insured’s consent, then Fox should advise physician that she can release the insurer from its obligations and assume the defense of the matter at her own expense. If the language is ambiguous, Fox should tell insured and insurer that the settlement may not be valid.

#### Consent from Client?  From Insurance Co.? 

Rule 1.8, Comment 11 says the insured is the client and the liability insurer will be the party compensating the lawyer.

Person Paying for a Lawyer's Services

[Comment 11] Lawyers are frequently asked to represent a client under circumstances in which a third person will compensate the lawyer, in whole or in part. 

The third person might be a relative or friend, an indemnitor (such as a liability insurance company) or a co-client (such as a corporation sued along with one or more of its employees). 

Because third-party payers frequently have interests that differ from those of the client, including interests in minimizing the amount spent on the representation and in learning how the representation is progressing, lawyers are prohibited from accepting or continuing such representations unless the lawyer determines that there will be no interference with the lawyer's independent professional judgment and there is informed consent from the client. See also Rule 5.4(c) (prohibiting interference with a lawyer's professional judgment by one who recommends, employs or pays the lawyer to render legal services for another).

HYPOTHETICAL from page 130 of TM. Guantanamo Bay defendants


Rule 1.8, Comment 12 talks about consent and how to obtain it. Normally, it will “be sufficient for the lawyer to obtain the client’s informed consent regarding the fact of the payment and the identity of the 3rd-party payer.” However if the fee arrangement creates a conflict of interest, then lawyer must comply with Rule 1.7.

#### Suppose insured turns on the insurer, during trial or otherwise?

Lawyer cannot abandon the insured or “take up the cudgels of the insurer against the insured” 

MONTANEZ case (p. 229). Suppose insured tells you one story in your office and a different story on the stand?

“impeachment of one’s own client was improper”

If insurer wants to sue the client for noncooperation, it could do so.

If there is perjury etc. then it gets handled under Rule 3.3 which we’ll reach in Problem 27 but that’s not the point here.

#### Insurer Retains Lawyer  to Represent Insured

Restatement Third says whether the lawyer has one client or two is a matter of insurance law, not the law governing lawyers.

Still in dispute. Insurance companies like to argue that they too are clients.

Old way to treat the problem was to make it a multiple client problem, but makes the analysis confusing.

May lawyer write a report to the insurer if the insured objects under Rule 1.6 (confidentiality)? Normally only the client may tell the lawyer to settle. The insurer may say, “Settle!” The insured may say, “No way!”

Right to sue for malpractice. Some states say only a client may sue, whereas probably only the insurer really suffers the financial loss. Either way 1.8(f) (compensation from one other than the client) and 1.7(a)(current conflicts) apply.

Henderson may owe enforceable duties to the insurance company if it is not a client, and these concerns do not go away if the lawyer has two clients instead of one.

#### Model Rule 1.8(f): Compensation From Third Parties

> A lawyer shall not accept compensation for representing a client from one other than the client unless: <br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(1)__ the client gives informed consent; <br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(2)__ there is no interference with the lawyer's independence of professional judgment or with the client-lawyer relationship; and <br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(3)__ information relating to representation of a client is protected as required by Rule 1.6.

__Plain English__: Lawyer shall NOT money from third person, UNLESS:

* Client gives informed consent;
* No interference!
* Info kept confidential!

### Paradigm Ins. Co. v. Langerman Law (AZ 2001)

Paradigm issued a med malpractice insurance policy covering Dr. Benjamin Vanderwerf. Vanderwerf was Medical Director of Samaritan Health Service (he worked for them). 

Patient Renee Taylor sues Vanderwerf and another Dr. for malpractice (for injuries suffered during catheter removal). Taylor also joins Samaritan as defendant (on the theory that Vanderwerf was Samaritan’s agent or employee at the time of the negligent act).

Paradigm Insurance assigns the case to lawyer Langerman, who appears as counsel for Vanderwerf. Langerman says, “I don’t see any theory of liability working against Samaritan.” But Langerman also neglects to check and see if Vanderwerf would be covered under Samaritan’s med mal insurance policies. Oops. Eventually Paradigm terminates Langerman’s representation (I wonder why?) and we get a new lawyer.

The new lawyer discovers that Samaritan had liability coverage that not only covered Taylor’s claims against Vanderwerf but probably operated as PRIMARY coverage for the claim. New counsel tendered the claim to Samaritan Insurance Funding, which rejected it as untimely.

Taylor v. Vanderwerf eventually settled for an amount within Paradigm’s policy limits. Vanderwerf not complaining, but Paradigm was forced to settle Taylor’s claim claim without being able to look to SIF. Langerman bills Paradigm for legal services, and Paradigm refuses to pay. Langerman sues for fees and Paradigm counterclaims for damages.

__Questions and Notes__: 

p. 320 Discussion EXPRESS AGREEMENT?

Langerman says “No attorney-client relationship between the lawyer and the insurance company unless there is express, mutual consent between all of the parties.” Since when? 

Do we recall a case where an attorney-client relationship was formed even though there was no express, mutual consent? (Togstadt).

Langerman argues that there are too many conflicts of interest in this relationship and unless the INSURED CONSENTS there is not attorney-client relationship between the lawyer and the insurance company.

See, RLGL §14, RLGL §51(3), comment g

Too many conflicts.

Is Langerman right? 

We saw one in my hypo right. What if Dr. Vanderwerf INTENTIONALLY injured Renee Taylor?

How about another. Can anybody think of another?   What if the insurance company wants to settle

And the Dr. just wants to clear his good name 

Okay, conflicts happen, that’s for sure, but do the insured and insurer have things in common, too? (pg 322 YES for e.g. they would both like to find additional coverage from another carrier.

Ct of Appeals said “in the absence of a conflict, the attorney has two clients, the insurer and the insured.”

Sct of Arizona says, “That’s too absolute”

“Thus we do not endorse the view that the lawyer automatically represents both insurer and insured until the conflict actually arises.” (p. 322)

Comment f to the restatement
<!-- Comment f of which part of the restatement? -->

Insurer should be accorded standing to assert a claim for appropriate relief from the lawyer for financial loss caused by professional negligence or other wrongful acts.

p. 324 “The lawyers services are ordinarily intended to benefit both insurer and insured when their interests coincide.”

Record does not allow us to determine whether Langerman actually breached his duty to Paradigm. 

Left to trial court to determine on remand.

## RLGL §14 Formation of Lawyer-Client Relationship

>__RLGL § 14. Formation of a Client-Lawyer Relationship__ <br />
>A relationship of client and lawyer arises when: <br />
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(1)__ a person manifests to a lawyer the person's intent that the lawyer provide legal services for the person; and either<br />
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(a)__ the lawyer manifests to the person consent to do so; or <br />
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(b)__ the lawyer fails to manifest lack of consent to do so, and the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the person reasonably relies on the lawyer to provide the services; or <br />
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(2)__ a tribunal with power to do so appoints the lawyer to provide the services.

__Plain English__: The lawyer-client relationship arises when:
a person wants the lawyer to provide legal services and EITHER
the lawyer consents OR
the lawyer “FAILS TO MANIFEST LACK OF CONSENT”

## RLGL §51(3), comment g (A liability insurer's claim for professional negligence)

>__Under Subsection (3), a lawyer designated by an insurer to defend an insured owes a duty of care to the insurer with respect to matters as to which the interests of the insurer and insured are not in conflict, whether or not the insurer is held to be a co-client of the lawyer (see § 134, Comment f)__. For example, if the lawyer negligently fails to oppose a motion for summary judgment against the insured and the insurer must pay the resulting adverse judgment, the insurer has a claim against the lawyer for any proximately caused loss. In such circumstances, the insured and insurer, under the insurance contract, both have a reasonable expectation that the lawyer's services will benefit both insured and insurer. Recognizing that the lawyer owes a duty to the insurer promotes enforcement of the lawyer's obligations to the insured. However, such a duty does not arise when it would significantly impair, in the circumstances of the representation, the lawyer's performance of obligations to the insured. For example, if the lawyer recommends acceptance of a settlement offer just below the policy limits and the insurer accepts the offer, the insurer may not later seek to recover from the lawyer on a claim that a competent lawyer in the circumstances would have advised that the offer be rejected. Allowing recovery in such circumstances would give the lawyer an interest in recommending rejection of a settlement offer beneficial to the insured in order to escape possible liability to the insurer.

Arizona has long recognized that lawyers MAY owe a duty of care to nonclients. 

## Model Rule 5.4(c)

>__Rule 5.4. Professional Independence Of A Lawyer__ <br />
>A lawyer shall not permit a person who recommends, employs, or pays the lawyer to render legal services for another to direct or regulate the lawyer's professional judgment in rendering such legal services.

<!-- The Presenter Notes contained the Rule 5.4 in its entirety and the comments -->

### PROBLEM: Dad Needs Help

__Problem 10-10__. Fox is an estate lawyer. One day he receives a visit from an agitated 50-ish man who says: “I need some help for Dad. It is too hard for Dad to travel downtown these days.” “Dad needs to change his will to make sure his grandchildren’s education is paid for.” What should Fox do?

__Rules__: MR 1.7, 1.8(f), 1.14 Comment [3], 5.4(c); RLGL §134

__Readings__: Machado v. Statewide Grievance Committee (Chapter 4) 

__Result__: Dad, not Son, is Fox’s client. Fox must visit his client to clarify Dad’s intent if Dad cannot come to Fox’s office.

__Reflections__: This problem introduces the conflict that arises when one person pays for or tries to control the legal representation of another. MR 1.8(f) (if son pays the bill) and 5.4(c) (even if son does not pay) make clear that the lawyer must identify the real client and the real client’s interests, even while dealing face-to-face with another person. Here, Fox must inform the client ̶ Dad ̶ that Son has contacted him and may pay the bill. He should reassure Dad about confidentiality, and clarify Dad’s intent in the matter to avoid interfering with Fox’s judgment on behalf of Dad. MR 1.14 Comment [3] does allow Son to assist Dad and be Dad’s agent for purposes of communication and the attorney-client privilege, but Fox must make clear to Son that he represents Dad, who alone must decide whether and how to change his will. 

You may also want to raise other scenarios that raise issues of third-party interference (mentioned in the Comments to RLGL §134 and in MR 1.8(f)), such as: employers who pay for the representation of employees; codefendants in criminal cases where one pays for the representation of all; children whose representation is paid for by parents; bankruptcy, where debtor’s counsel is paid for by nondebtor third parties; or nonprofit organizations that pay for legal representation of their clients.

__Discipline__: Md. attorney. Grievance Comm’n v. Coppola, 19 A. 3d 421 (Md. 2011) (lawyer who gave in to family’s emotional appeal at mother’s deathbed to allow them to forge mother’s signature on estate documents disbarred); In re Flack, 33 P.3d 1281 (Kan. 2001) (lawyer who, inter alia, failed to abide by impaired client’s objectives in estate planning placed on probation for two years); People v. Rivers, 933 P.2d 6 (Colo. 1997) (lawyer did not disclose conflicts that arose from the payment of his fee by the client’s girlfriend, who was also the victim of client’s domestic violence).
