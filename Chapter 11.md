<!-- This is basically a new chapter collecting materials from various chapters in the 2nd edition. -->


## Model Rule 1.9(a) Duties to Former Clients
(looks at the individual lawyer)

>__Rule 1.9(a)__ 
>A lawyer who has formerly represented __a client__ in a matter shall not thereafter represent __another person__ in the __same or a substantially related matter__ in which that person's interests are __materially adverse__ to the interests of the former client __unless__ the former client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.

>__Rule 1.9, Comment [3]__ <br/>
>Matters are "substantially related" for purposes of this Rule if they involve the same transaction or legal dispute or if there otherwise is a substantial risk that confidential factual information as would normally have been obtained in the prior representation would materially advance the client's position in the subsequent matter. For example, a lawyer who has represented a businessperson and learned extensive private financial information about that person may not then represent that person's spouse in seeking a divorce. Similarly, a lawyer who has previously represented a client in securing environmental permits to build a shopping center would be precluded from representing neighbors seeking to oppose rezoning of the property on the basis of environmental considerations; however, the lawyer would not be precluded, on the grounds of substantial relationship, from defending a tenant of the completed shopping center in resisting eviction for nonpayment of rent. Information that has been disclosed to the public or to other parties adverse to the former client ordinarily will not be disqualifying. Information acquired in a prior representation may have been rendered obsolete by the passage of time, a circumstance that may be relevant in determining whether two representations are substantially related. In the case of an __organizational client__, general knowledge of the client’s policies and practices ordinarily will not preclude a subsequent representation; on the other hand, knowledge of specific facts gained in a prior representation that are relevant to the matter in question ordinarily will preclude such a representation. A former client is _not required to reveal the confidential information learned by the lawyer in order to establish a substantial risk that the lawyer has confidential information to use in the subsequent matter_. A conclusion about the possession of such information may be based on the nature of the services the lawyer provided the former client and information that would in ordinary practice be learned by a lawyer providing such services.


## Rule 1.9(b) Duties To to Former Clients
(looks at "the firm")

>__(b)__ A lawyer shall not knowingly represent a person in the _same or a substantially related matter_ in which a firm with which the lawyer formerly was associated had previously represented a client <br/>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(1)__ whose interests are _materially adverse_ to that person; and <br/>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(2)__ about whom the lawyer had acquired information protected by Rules 1.6 and 1.9(c) that is material to the matter;
>
>unless the former client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.


## same or substantially related matter?

* same transaction or legal dispute . . . (easy!)
* risk that confidential factual information (as would normally have been obtained in the prior representation) would materially advance the client’s position in the subsequent matter . . . (hard!)

<!-- Cited Rule 1.9, Comment 3 text from Rule 1.9(a) slide in the Presenter Notes -->


## Rule 1.9(c) Duties To Former Clients 

>__(c)__ A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter __or__ whose _present or former_ firm has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter: <br/>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(1)__ _use information_ relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former client except as these Rules would permit or require with respect to a client, or when the information has become generally known; or <br/>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(2)__ _reveal information_ relating to the representation except as these Rules would permit or require with respect to a client.

__Plain English__: Formerly represented clients shall be treated like current clients when it comes to using or revealing information.

This is the eternal commandment, okay: ”I will hire you as my lawyer if you agree to keep your mouth shut about my business and personal affairs.”

So even former clients are ENTITLED to be treated like current clients. Courts will not allow the the lawyer to take arms against a former client and use information gleaned from the prior representation as ammo for attacking the client in a similar matter. 

__Formerly represented clients shall be treated like current clients when it comes to using or revealing information.__

Client hires lawyer and is entitled to must agree to trust . . .


## Does “matter” refer only to litigation?

* Clearly no.
* Both the rule and the comments say as much.

If you help four doctors form a partnership, you can’t later help a third party undo that partnership.

If you draft a will, even if it’s 20 years ago, you can’t later represent a 3rd party beneficiary in a will contest. 

You draft a lease for somebody, the provision you wrote representing the landlord survives in subsequent drafts of the lease, you can’t later represent a tenant and sue to invalidate that provision.


## When Are Matters the "Same or Substantially Related"?

> __Restat 3d of the Law Governing Lawyers, § 132. A Representation Adverse to the Interests of a Former Client__
> 
> Unless both the affected present and former clients consent to the representation under the limitations and conditions provided in § 122, a lawyer who has represented a client in a matter may not thereafter represent another client in the same or a substantially related matter in which the interests of the former client are materially adverse. __The current matter is substantially related to the earlier matter if:__ <br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(1) the current matter involves the work the lawyer performed for the former client; or__ <br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__(2) there is a substantial risk that representation of the present client will involve the use of information acquired in the course of representing the former client, unless that information has become generally known.__

__Plain English__: Current matter is substantially related within the meaning of Rule 1.9 if:

* The current matter involves the work the lawyer performed for the former client;
* There is a substantial risk that the representation of the present client will involve the use of __information__ acquired in the course of representing the former client.


## “substantially related”

* Just look at substantial relationship.
* DON’T get into asking what confidential information was disclosed
* Defeats the purpose.
* The lawyer swearing “I don’t remember anything” is not a factor.
* Study Rule 1.9 Comment 3.

<!-- Presenter Notes: -->

7th cir Analytica, purely structural; or American Airlines case duty of loyalty; 

Look at Rule 1.9 comment 3


## Rule 1.9

* Same
* Substantially related

Same MATTER, usually easy. You drew up partnership papers for 4 doctors five years ago, now one of them comes to you and wants your help in DISSOLVING the partnership.

You drafted a lease for a tenant, now the landlord wants to hire you to have the lease declared invalid. Those are easy. 

What does substantially related mean?

Posner Analytica. Corporate reorganization is substantially related to antitrust. 

Loyalty. American Airlines case.

Stick with matter and information 


## Examples of Same or Related (Rule 1.9, Comment 3)

>[A] lawyer who has represented a businessperson and learned extensive private financial information about that person may not then represent that person's spouse in seeking a divorce.

>[A] lawyer who has previously represented a client in securing environmental permits to build a shopping center would be precluded from representing neighbors seeking to oppose rezoning of the property on the basis of environmental considerations; however, the lawyer would not be precluded, on the grounds of substantial relationship, from defending a tenant of the completed shopping center in resisting eviction for nonpayment of rent. 

Information that has been disclosed to the public or to other parties adverse to the former client ordinarily will not be disqualifying


## Rule 1.9(c)

> A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter or whose present or former firm has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter: <br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) use information relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former client except as these Rules would permit or require with respect to a client, or when the information has become generally known; or <br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) reveal information relating to the representation except as these Rules would permit or require with respect to a client.

__Plain English__: A lawyer [or their presenter/former firm] who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter: (1) use information relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former client, or (2) reveal information EXCEPT as these rules rules would permit as to a CLIENT. 

See what’s happened?

<!-- Slide 16-18 just copied Rule 1.9(a) or 1.9(b) slides -->


## Example: 

So lawyer represents landlord Green, who is always having legal problems with Tenants. So lawyer drafts a boilerplate LEASE for Landlord Green to use when renting to his clients. After a few years, Landlord Green says I can’t afford your rates any more, “Goodbye.”

Here is what MAY NOT happen under 1.9(a), the lawyer may NOT . . . 

For Rule 1.9(b) we do the same thing, only instead of looking at a LAWYER who actually represented Landlord Green, we look at a lawyer who worked in THE FIRM that represented Landlord Green.

A lawyer shall not knowingly represent a person in the same or a substantially related matter in which a firm with which the lawyer formerly was associated had previously represented a client:

1. whose interests are materially adverse to that person; and 
2. __about whom the lawyer had acquired information protected by Rules 1.6 and 1.9(c)__

<!-- Slide 20 just copied Rule 1.9(b) slide -->


## Rule 1.10. Imputation

If a lawyer is disqualified by Rule 1.7 (Conflict of Interest: Current Clients) or Rule 1.9 (Duties to Former Clients), then, under Rule 1.10(a), all other lawyers in his or her firm are also disqualified.


## Should “personal” conflicts be imputed throughout a firm?

>__Rule 1.10(a)__: No lawyers in a firm shall represent a client when any one of them can’t UNLESS (1) “the prohibition is based on a _personal interest_ . . .”

<!-- Have not changed/checked the wording -->

The Rules should not preclude a firm from representing the fur industry just because one associate feels strongly about animal rights. If that were the law the courts enforced, it would give the firm a good reason to ask the associate to leave the firm. 

On the other hand, if a senior partner has STRONGLY-HELD views, maybe her interest would be broad enough to justify imputation.

But then again if the partner were so influential, the law firm may not have take the case to begin with. 

How absolute is the rule of imputation?


## SCREENING
### The use of "screening" to avoid imputation

New ABA Model Rule 1.10 recognizes the availability of screening to avoid imputation __where lawyers have moved from one firm to another__. 

Look at the State-by-State analysis on pages 120-21 (State-by-state rules in supplement). Great majority of states have rejected a rule providing for screening.

Chinese Walls, cones of silence.

The opponent can never know whether the firm is complying or cheating. Further there are too many chances for inadvertent leaks in day-to-day practice.

Courts sometimes allow it but now you are using common law to amend the Model Rules of Professional Responsibility. 


### Screening in general.

Note!

<!-- I don't know why "Note!" is in here -->

Rule 1.10 (a)(2)’s screening provisions are BRAND NEW.

Less than half of current jurisdictions permit screening to avoid imputation for lawyers in private practice.

Go to page 155-56; also See Terminology and comments 8,9,10


### Rule 1.10 Imputation

>While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7 or 1.9, unless
>the prohibition is based on a personal interest of the disqualified lawyer and does not present a significant risk of materially limiting the representation of the client by the remaining lawyers in the firm; or
>the prohibition is based upon Rule 1.9(a) or (b) and arises out of the disqualified lawyer’s association with a prior firm, and . . . . 

<!-- Have not changed/checked the wording -->


### Screening

* No fee! $
* Written notice to affected client: 
    * description of procedures; 
    * statement of compliance; 
    * agreement to respond.
* Certifications of compliance


### Screening under 1.10? Not in Nebraska?

<!-- Screenshot of NE Rule 3-501.10 -->


## Model Rule 1.10

> (b) When a lawyer has terminated an association with a firm, the firm is not prohibited from thereafter representing a person with interests materially adverse to those of a client represented by the formerly associated lawyer and not currently represented by the firm, unless:
> (1) the matter is the same or substantially related to that in which the formerly associated lawyer represented the client; and
> (2) any lawyer remaining in the firm has information protected by Rules 1.6 and 1.9(c) that is material to the matter.

(c) Except as law may otherwise expressly permit, 

a lawyer having information that the lawyer knows is confidential government information about a person acquired when the lawyer was a public officer or employee, 

may not represent a private client whose interests are adverse to that person in a matter in which the information could be used to the material disadvantage of that person. As used in this Rule, the term "confidential government information" means information that has been obtained under governmental authority and which, at the time this Rule is applied, the government is prohibited by law from disclosing to the public or has a legal privilege not to disclose and which is not otherwise available to the public. A firm with which that lawyer is associated may undertake or continue representation in the matter only if the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom.


## Rule Model Rule 1.11. Special Conflicts . . . For Government Officers And Employees

(b) When a lawyer is disqualified from representation under paragraph (a), no lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in such a matter unless:
(1) the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and
(2) written notice is promptly given to the appropriate government agency to enable it to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this rule.

## Slide 39

<!-- Picture on Slide 39 -->

A leaked email from a Goldman (GS) executive admits that the firm’s internal research analysis shared trading ideas with its proprietary trading desk before sharing them with some clients.

There’s always so much speculation about how GS is such a great trading firm, this is some more confirmation that what they do isn’t always 100% kosher.

Just for the uncynical there is “supposed” to be a long-standing “Chinese Wall” that divides the Research and Sales sides of investment bankers.  This is to prevent conflicts of interest and pressure on Analysts to recommend a stock.

But, we’ve seen for 30 years that a company coincidentally always recommends a stock when it gets a piece of the issuing IPO, for example.  Perception of ethics in trading/finance took a hard hit with the Madoffs and other scandals of recent years — we’ve seen recently that some corporations will often literally show no ethics/morality when it comes to profits or bookkeeping.

In my view, it would be nice if the government/SEC could finally get tough on these measures which create an uneven playing field for many traders.  Of course, how many of our recent Treasury Secretaries (under BOTH Democrat and Republican administrations) are GS alumni?

> (2) shall not otherwise represent a client in connection with

<!-- Have not changed/checked the wording -->

Rule 1.11 Special Conflicts Of Interest For Former And Current Government Officers And Employees

Private work following government work on the same matter. Must NOT represent a private client in a MATTER in which the lawyer participated PERSONALLY AND SUBSTANTIALLY while in government service, unless the govt agency gives its informed consent, confirmed in writing

MATTER means a specific dispute involving specific facts and parties. 1.11(e) very broad

PERSONALLY AND SUBSTANTIALLY means that the lawyer worked on the matter herself and that her work was more than superficial or trifling.

<!-- Slide 42 same as Rule 1.9(a) slides -->


## Rule 1.9(c) Duties To Former Clients 

> A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter OR whose present or former firm has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter: 
> use information relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former client except as these Rules would permit or require with respect to a client, or when the information has become generally known; or 
> reveal information relating to the representation except as these Rules would permit or require with respect to a client.

## Rule 1.9 (private) vs. Rule 1.11 (govt)

* On what matters may a former government lawyer work after leaving the agency?
* the standard under MR 1.11 IS NOT “SAME OR SUBSTANTIAL RELATIONSHIP” as in Rule 1.9, but 
* whether the lawyer “PERSONALLY AND SUBSTANTIALLY” PARTICIPATED IN THE “MATTER.” 

a distinction the problem is intended to permit the class to explore.  

You might also point out that this rule, though narrower in scope than MR 1.9, is broader because it does not require “adverse representation.”


<!-- Slide 48 is same as Slide 38 -->


## Rule 1.11 (Dooling version)

(a) A former govt lawyer
(1) Is subject to 1.9(c) (may not use or disclose confidential information);
(2) must get consent from govt before representing clients in connection with matters in which they personally and substantially participated while working for the govt
(b) A disqualified former govt lawyer’s FIRM may represent clients IF former govt lawyer is screened and notice given.


## Rule 1.11(c)

Very similar to Rule 1.9(c) (shall not use or disclose confidential information) except here it concerns “confidential information about a person acquired when the lawyer” worked for the govt.

A govt lawyer who receives confidential info about a person must not later represent a private client whose interests are adverse to that person A, when the information could be used to harm person A.

You were a prosecutor. You learned from a confidential informant about my drug habit.

You go into private practice. 

My wife wants to hire you to sue me for divorce. You can’t use or disclose the info about my drug habit.

Subsequent use of information gained during govt service


## Rule 1.11(d)

> (d) A current govt lawyer
> (1) is subject to Rules 1.7 (conflicts) and 1.9 (former clients)
> (2) Shall NOT
> (i) participate in a matter in which the lawyer personally and substantially participated while in private practice unless agency gives consent
> (ii) can’t solicit private employment from parties

And Bauer steps through the revolving doors and starts representing Lincoln on the OTHER SIDE of the government.


## PROBLEM: Government Lawyers

Problem 11-9(a). Martyn & Fox recently hired Julia Davis, a lawyer who worked for the state attorney general’s office for the past six years. Ms. Davis’ first case in the AG’s office was the successful defense of a race discrimination class action against the State Department of Taxation. Can Martyn & Fox take on the representation of Paula Pearson, who wishes to bring a race discrimination complaint against the State Department of Taxation based on events that occurred four years after Ms. Davis’ defense of the Department?

[this is 9-20 question (a)]

__Rules__: MR 1.11; RLGL §133

__Readings__: Lawyers and Clients: Governments

__Result__: Yes, and Martyn & Fox should screen Davis if she has the former client’s relevant confidences.

__Reflections__: This problem addresses the special situation, found in MR 1.11, of the lawyer who leaves government service to go into private practice.  In order to encourage lawyers to enter public service, and not turn them into Typhoid Marys when they seek employment with firms regularly appearing before the agencies in which they worked, the rule permits screening such lawyers from participation in certain matters while the firm continues to handle the matter from which it would otherwise be disqualified.

The more difficult question is on what matters the former government lawyer may work after leaving the agency.  

THE STANDARD UNDER MR 1.11 IS NOT “SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY RELATED MATTER” AS IN MR 1.9, but whether THE LAWYER “PERSONALLY AND SUBSTANTIALLY” PARTICIPATED IN THE “MATTER,” a distinction the problem is intended to permit the class to explore.  

You might also point out that this rule, though narrower in scope than MR 1.9, is broader because it does not require “adverse representation.”

Here, the limits of “matter” arguably have been reached, because the old matter has concluded.  The problem also raises the issue whether the substantial relationship test also should apply.  MR 1.11(a) says “no” except for 1.9(c), which would require the former agency to show that Davis actually has confidential information relevant to this case.  Even then, Martyn & Fox could screen Davis under MR 1.11(b).  

MR 1.9(c) information includes not only that gained from working on a prior matter, but also overheard phone calls or conversations between other lawyers who worked on the matter for the government.

<!-- See also, Slide 54 (Four years after!) -->


## PROBLEM: Government Lawyers

__Problem 11-9(b)__. Martyn & Fox recently hired Julia Davis, a lawyer who worked for the state attorney general’s office for the past six years. In her last case, she served as lead counsel in negotiating a settlement in an antitrust suit on behalf of the State Department of Transportation against General Motors. Can Martyn & Fox take on the representation of Local Municipality against General Motors based on facts identical to the State Department of Transportation case?

[this is 9-20 question (b)]

__Rules__:  MR 1.11; 18 U.S.C. §207; RLGL §133

__Readings__: Lawyers and Clients: Governments

__Result__: Davis could do so with the consent of her former agency; Martyn & Fox could take the case even without consent if it adequately screens Davis.

__Reflections__:  With respect to “matter,” MR 1.11(d) and Comment [10] point out that, as in this problem, “a “matter” may continue in another form.  This problem also points to another policy rationale for the rule.  It is intended to discourage government lawyers not only from side-switching but also from handling a particular assignment in such a way as to encourage later private benefit, for example, treble damages and attorney’s fees as in this case.

At this point it is important to warn students that it is not just lawyer codes, but also government statutes and regulations, with which the departing government lawyer will want to become thoroughly familiar before undertaking any post-government employment. 

Lawyers and Clients: Governments traverses this territory.  You can wrap up this discussion with another hypo: Could a Department of Justice lawyer who worked on an environmental matter write a pro bono amicus brief on behalf of a private client in the same case after leaving the government?  Here, although such action may be allowed with appropriate consent under MR 1.11, it would constitute a crime under 18 U.S.C. §207(a).


<!-- Slide 57 just presents 1.9(c) -->


## Model Rules Scope

#### Body 

> [18] Under various legal provisions . . . the responsibilities of government lawyers may include authority concerning legal matters that ordinarily reposes in the client in private client-lawyer relationships. 
> For example, a lawyer . . . may have authority on behalf of the government to decide upon settlement or whether to appeal from an adverse judgment . . . .
> These Rules do not abrogate any such authority.

<!-- Have not changed/checked the wording -->

including constitutional, statutory and common law,

Such authority in various respects is generally vested in the attorney general and the state's attorney in state government, and their federal counterparts, and the same may be true of other government law officers. 

Also, lawyers under the supervision of these officers may be authorized to represent several government agencies in intragovernmental legal controversies in circumstances where a private lawyer could not represent multiple private clients.


## Don’t Forget OTHER Rules

Could a Department of Justice Employee who worked on an environmental matter write a pro bono amicus brief on behalf of a private client in the same case after leaving the government?

Yes with consent under Rule 1.11, but then there’s this statute

18 USC section 207 

(a) Restrictions on All Officers and Employees of the Executive Branch and Certain Other Agencies.—
(1) Permanent restrictions on representation on particular matters.— Any person who is an officer or employee (including any special Government employee) of the executive branch of the United States (including any independent agency of the United States), or of the District of Columbia, and who, after the termination of his or her service or employment with the United States or the District of Columbia, 

knowingly makes, with the intent to influence, any communication to or appearance before any officer or employee of any department, agency, court, or court-martial of the United States or the District of Columbia, on behalf of any other person (except the United States or the District of Columbia) in connection with a particular matter—
(A) in which the United States or the District of Columbia is a party or has a direct and substantial interest,
(B) in which the person participated personally and substantially as such officer or employee, and
(C) which involved a specific party or specific parties at the time of such participation,
shall be punished as provided in section 216 of this title.


## Rule 1.13: Organization As Client  Comment 9

“The duty defined in this Rule applies to governmental organizations.”

<!-- Have not changed/checked the wording -->

Defining precisely the identity of the client and prescribing the resulting obligations of such lawyers may be more difficult in the government context and is a matter beyond the scope of these Rules. 


## Former & Prospective Clients

Both are treated like clients when it comes to USING or REVEALING information.


## Prospective Clients

For example, a consultation is likely to have occurred if a lawyer
either in person or through the lawyer’s advertising in any medium
specifically requests or invites the submission of information about a potential representation 
without clear and reasonably understandable warnings . . . statements that limit the lawyer’s obligations, and a person provides information in response

<!-- This was in the markdown file, but not on Slide 62 -->

Prospective clients, now explicitly different than targets of solicitation as we’ve just seen.


## Model Rule 1.18. Duties To Prospective Clients

The old rule:

>(a) a person who discusses with a lawyer the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship . . .

The new rule:

>(a) a person who _consults_ with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship . . .

These minor changes occur throughout, where the 20/20 Commission has done is touch-ups here and there changing antique references to letters or documents to “communications” or “including electronic communications,”

A person becomes a prospective client by consulting with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship with respect to a matter. 

Whether communications constitute a consultation depends on the circumstances.

a consultation is likely to have occurred if a lawyer, either in person or through the lawyer’s advertising in any medium, 

specifically requests or invites the submission of information about a potential representation without clear and reasonably understandable warnings and cautionary statements that limit the lawyer’s obligations, and a person provides information in response. 

In contrast, a consultation does not occur if a person provides information to a lawyer in response to advertising that merely describes the lawyer’s education, experience, areas of practice, and contact information, or provides legal information of general interest. 

But again we ARE IN A GRAY AREA if you look at some attorney websites or advertising.

If it says CONTACT DOOLING AND DOOLING IF YOU TOOK CELEBREX and NOW HAVE two heads instead of one, our experts will comb through you medical records. 

Is that SOLICITING A CONSULTATION? Is that inviting you to send your medical records? 

Bearing in mind that we look at this from the REASONABLE CLIENT’S PERSPECTIVE, NOT THE REASONABLE LAWYER’S PERSPECTIVE

It’s tricky because IF THAT IS A CONSULTATION THEN IT TRIGGERS DUTIES

---------

A person who communicates Such a person communicates information unilaterally to a lawyer, without any reasonable expectation that the lawyer is willing to discuss the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship, and is thus not a "prospective client." within the meaning of paragraph (a). Moreover, a person who communicates with a lawyer for the purpose of disqualifying the lawyer is not a “prospective client.”


A big gnarly rule. It prefigures 1.7 and 1.9


## Model Rule 1.18, Comment 2

> A person who communicates information unilaterally to a lawyer, without any reasonable expectation that the lawyer is willing to discuss the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship, is not a "prospective client." within the meaning of paragraph (a). 
> Moreover, a person who communicates with a lawyer for the purpose of disqualifying the lawyer is not a “prospective client.”


## Model Rule 7.3 __Solicitation of Clients__

>(a) A lawyer shall not by in-person, live telephone or real-time electronic contact solicit professional employment . . . 

Solicitation. The most important change here is almost a TERMINOLOGY CONSIDERATION

Ethics 20/20 Commission  wanted this changed to SOLICITATION OF CLIENTS.

As we’ll see very quickly the term PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS is now almost a term of art 

“a person who CONSULTS with a lawyer the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship . . .

and is confined to Rule 1.18

dealing with CONSULTATION of prospective clients. 


## Model Rule 1.18. Duties To Prospective Clients

>(b) EVEN WHEN NO CLIENT LAWYER RELATIONSHIP ENSUES . . . a lawyer shall not USE OR REVEAL that information . . .

Even when no client relationship exists.

Because you may NOT USE OR REVEAL THAT INFORMATION

And it also MAY constrain your ability to represent adverse parties.

Under 1.18(c)

 

## Model Rule 1.18 Comment 2

What does “consult” mean?
A consultation does not occur if a person provides information to a lawyer in response to advertising that merely describes the lawyer’s education, experience, areas of practice, and contact information, or provides legal information of general interest.


A person who consults with a lawyer the possibility of forming a client lawyer relationship

[2]  A person becomes a prospective client by consulting with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship with respect to a matter.  Whether communications, including written, oral, or electronic communications, constitute a consultation depends on the circumstances.  For example, a consultation is likely to have occurred if a lawyer, either in person or through the lawyer’s advertising in any medium, specifically requests or invites the submission of information about a potential representation without clear and reasonably understandable warnings and cautionary statements that limit the lawyer’s obligations, and a person provides information in response. See also Comment [4].  In contrast, a consultation does not occur if a person provides information to a lawyer in response to advertising that merely describes the lawyer’s education, experience, areas of practice, and contact information, or provides legal information of general interest. Such a person communicates information unilaterally to a lawyer, without any reasonable expectation that the lawyer is willing to discuss the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship, and is thus not a "prospective client." Moreover, a person who communicates with a lawyer for the purpose of disqualifying the lawyer is not a “prospective client.”

at least in terms of email and websites to use just a little technological common sense and avoid this whole problem entirely.

## PROBLEM: Former Clients

__Problem 11-1__. Three years ago, Martyn & Fox prepared tax returns for Wife’s business.  Husband now wants Martyn & Fox to represent him in a divorce. Can we? Does it matter if we prepared the tax returns ten years ago? What if we handled an employment discrimination claim for Wife’s business?

__Rules__: MR 1.9(a) Comment [3]; RLGL §132

__Readings__: Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman; Cascades Branding

__Result__: If Wife, not Wife’s business, was the client, Martyn & Fox
probably will be subject to discipline or disqualification if they
represent Husband. 

If Wife’s business was the client, Martyn & Fox may
be subject to the same consequences if its lawyers learned information about Wife that could be used against her in the divorce. Discipline or disqualification is less likely if the prior representation was an employment discrimination claim.

__Result__:  If Wife, not Wife’s business, was the client, Martyn & Fox probably will be subject to discipline or disqualification if they represent Husband.  

If Wife’s business was the client, Martyn & Fox may be subject to the same consequences if its lawyers learned information about Wife that could be used against her in the divorce. 

Ten years later is a much closer question.

__Reflections__: This problem and the next focus the class’ attention on MR 1.9.  First, consider whether Wife is a former client.  If she reasonably believed she was, or if her business was a sole proprietorship, she qualifies.  It is also possible that her business was the client but she was not.  Note that even if Wife was not a former client under MR 1.9(a), she may still have some protection under 1.9(c) if she actually disclosed confidential information in the course of obtaining representation for her business.

Second, if Wife is a former client, are the tax returns and the subsequent divorce “substantially related”?  At least three years have passed since the firm worked on her tax returns, though query whether any other work has been done for her business or her since then.  Here, students can profit by applying the test Oasis and Cascades and making clear that whether a substantial relationship exists depends upon the nature and scope of a typical prior representation in which the client may have disclosed confidences relevant to the current case.  

Once a substantial relationship has been found, courts create an irrebuttable presumption that the lawyer did in fact receive relevant confidential information.  Former lawyers are not allowed to rebut the presumption that they received this information because otherwise, former clients would have to disclose the exact confidences they are trying to protect.  T.C. Theatre Corp. v. Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., 113 F. Supp. 265 (S.D.N.Y. 1953).  

Comment [3] to MR 1.9 nicely summarizes the vast case law that applies the substantial relationship test.  It emphasizes both the facts and legal issues in the two matters to determine whether a substantial relationship exists. See, e.g., Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Gulf Oil Corp., 588 F.2d 221, 225 (7th Cir. 1978).  Some cases appear to focus more on the legal issues in the two matters and require that they be virtually identical and the relationship between them “patently clear.” Govt. of India v. Cook Indus., Inc., 569 F.2d 737 (2d Cir. 1978).  Others focus on “whether the factual contexts of the two representations are similar or related.” Graham v. Wyeth Laboratories, 906 F.2d 1419 (10th Cir. 1990).  Ultimately, all of these courts require careful attention to each case’s specific legal and factual context to determine whether confidential information might be used against the former client in the current matter.    

Given this understanding, the facts in this problem are substantially related, but the passage of time here might render the information “obsolete.”  Note that even if the time period renders the matters not substantially related, MR 1.9(c) raises another related issue: whether the firm actually learned confidential information about Wife’s business that might be used in representing Husband in the divorce.  Solving that issue will depend upon the nature of the information and the issues in the divorce.  What if, for example, Wife disclosed problems with drug abuse in the context of her prior business representation?    Finally, if Martyn cannot take the case, MR 1.10 also prevents Martyn & Fox from doing so.  This point is illustrated by Maritrans, where the court essentially applied the substantial relationship test to enjoin the firm from subsequent representation of competitors.

Finally note that MR 1.9 former-client conflicts, unlike current-client MR 1.7 conflicts, are always consentable.  How likely is consent on these facts?


## PROBLEM: Former Clients

__Problem 11-2(a)__. Martyn was general counsel for Capital Hospital for ten years before joining Martyn & Fox. Can Martyn & Fox represent Small Hospital, a competitor of Capital, in lobbying the state legislature for changes in state Medicaid rates?

__Rules__: MR 1.9(a), Comment [3], 1.10; RLGL §132, Comment d(ii)

__Readings__: Mitchell v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.

__Result__: (a) Probably
(b) Depends on whether the matter is substantially related and adverse to the former client.
(c) Depends on when the alleged malpractice occurred and the extent of Martyn’s playbook information.  

__Reflections__: This problem is intended to permit further exploration of the substantial relationship concept, and the apparent exception of “generally known information” in RLGL §132(2) and MR 1.9(c)(1), which the students should be cautioned not to read too broadly.  

RLGL § 132 Comment d points out that some information might be “so general, readily observable, or of little value in the subsequent representation that it should not itself result in a substantial relationship.”  Examples include mastering a particular substantive area of the law, learning a former client’s preferred approach to bargaining in a transaction or financial ability to withstand negotiation or litigation.  It cautions, however, that these categories of information could be substantially related when “such information will be directly in issue or of unusual value the subsequent matter.”  

Understanding the limits on “generally known” focuses students on the factual information the lawyer received in the prior representation and its relationship to the current matter, as both Maritrans and Eastman Kodak  instruct.

(a)  Here, Martyn & Fox simply want to represent a competitor of a former client.  Without more, it is generally thought that such representation is perfectly appropriate, though no one would be surprised if the long-term, former client, particularly in the case of its former general counsel, argued that former general counsel is simply barred from representing a competitor for some period of time.  

Recall that in Maritrans the court found a substantial relationship because the confidential information about labor costs was so related to the subsequent representation of the competitors.  Here, even if such a substantial relationship exists, query whether the subsequent representation is materially adverse.  If not, Capital Hospital cannot complain. 

(b) The second part of this problem cuts a little closer to the bone.  Here, there does appear to be some substantial relationship with the advice general counsel gave its former client and the advice being provided to this hospital in another county.  However, the matter may not be substantially related, or the issues conflicting, if the subsequent advice is about Sunshine’s rehab center and Capital does not compete in that market.  On the other hand, if Sunshine Hospital is operating in a county adjacent to Capital and expanding in the same market, the matters appear to be both substantially related and materially adverse. 

(c) This representation raises yet a different question.  The answer will depend in part on whether former general counsel was still employed by Capital at the time of the alleged medical malpractice and whether former general counsel “touched” this matter back then.  Even if there is no temporal connection, one would not be surprised to find that Capital moved to disqualify Martyn & Fox on the ground that former general counsel knows Capital’s “playbook” for handling malpractice claims.  This presents a good opportunity to discuss the issue of when playbook information qualifies as “substantially related.”

## PROBLEM: Imputed Conflicts

__Problem 11-3__. Martyn & Fox signs a joint defense agreement with a law firm representing a co-defendant of Martyn & Fox's client. Plaintiff succeeds in getting the other law firm disqualified because plaintiff is the other firm’s former client. What happens to Martyn & Fox?

__Rules__: MR 1.0(c), 1.9(b); RLGL §124(1) Ill. 3-5

__Readings__: Mitchell v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.; Practice Pointers: Implementing a Conflicts Control System

__Result__: Depends on the nature of the joint defense agreement and the information actually shared between Martyn & Fox and the disqualified firm.

__Reflections__: This problem introduces students to the concept of joint defense agreements, an ever increasingly used device to facilitate the work of multiple lawyers representing multiple defendants (or plaintiffs).  

The class may wish to discuss why they are needed.  Students should quickly recognize their importance in avoiding a waiver of the privilege for discussions among counsel and for protecting as privileged the conversations among counsel (RLGL §76).

That having been established, the students then can confront this problem, which raises the issue of whether disqualification of one law firm in a joint defense agreement also disqualifies all the other law firms who have been sharing privileged information.  

How does the present or former client that raised the conflict know whether the conflicted law firm has not infected the other counsel with the client’s confidential information?  

The answer lies in MR 1.9(b), also known as the peripheral representation rule.  Here, Martyn & Fox did not “represent” the client seeking disqualification; so MR 1.9(a)’s substantial relationship test does not apply.  Martyn & Fox may, however be treated as a “firm” within the meaning of MR 1.9(b), which allows Martyn & Fox to rebut the presumption they received confidences by showing that they never had access to the movant’s confidential information.  

The idea of peripheral representation arose in cases where lawyers worked for large firms for a relatively short period of time and had only a minor role in the prior representation.  Here, courts held that the migrating lawyer could rebut the presumption of shared confidences (which also might be raised by a joint defense agreement) by showing that the lawyer in fact had no access to relevant confidential information.  

The same idea has been applied to prospective clients (hence MR 1.18 and RLGL §15) and members of represented associations or groups, as well as joint defense agreements as in this problem.  Cases about other law firm employees, such as secretaries and paralegals, follow the same principles.

    * physical separation of attys & files;
    * common financial interest?
    * protection of client confidences


Public defenders. Concern for client protection is often higher because of the greater protections afforded criminal defendants.

Remember conflicts in CRIMINAL cases can rise to constitutional problems; ineffective assistance of counsel etc.

Should be okay if co-defendants are represented by lawyers from physically separate public defender’s offices, even if, for some purposes, the offices are linked in a state-wide network.

ABA Formal Opinion (paragraph c on page 260) whether the law firms have a “close and regular, continuing and semi-permanent relationship.”

An affiliated law firm usually means the firms share a common partner or share fees in a case or hold themselves out as affiliated.

Relationship between primary firm and its local counsel would not normally seem to be a per se affiliation. 


## What if Lawyers Share Office Space  but not Fees?

Rule 1.0 Comment 2: “Two practitioners who share office space and occasionally consult or assist each other ORDINARILY would not be regarded as constituting a firm.”
However if they act like a firm and present themselves to the public like a firm, then they will be treated like a firm under the Rules.


Kind of an odd rule. Why is the PUBLIC FACE important if they in fact protect client confidences from disclosure within the office and do not share legal fees.

[2] Whether two or more lawyers constitute a firm within paragraph (c) can depend on the specific facts. For example, two practitioners who share office space and occasionally consult or assist each other ordinarily would not be regarded as constituting a firm. However, if they present themselves to the public in a way that suggests that they are a firm or conduct themselves as a firm, they should be regarded as a firm for purposes of the Rules. The terms of any formal agreement between associated lawyers are relevant in determining whether they are a firm, as is the fact that they have mutual access to information concerning the clients they serve. Furthermore, it is relevant in doubtful cases to consider the underlying purpose of the Rule that is involved. A group of lawyers could be regarded as a firm for purposes of the Rule that the same lawyer should not represent opposing parties in litigation, while it might not be so regarded for purposes of the Rule that information acquired by one lawyer is attributed to another.

[3] With respect to the law department of an organization, including the government, there is ordinarily no question that the members of the department constitute a firm within the meaning of the Rules of Professional Conduct. There can be uncertainty, however, as to the identity of the client. For example, it may not be clear whether the law department of a corporation represents a subsidiary or an affiliated corporation, as well as the corporation by which the members of the department are directly employed. A similar question can arise concerning an unincorporated association and its local affiliates.

[4] Similar questions can also arise with respect to lawyers in legal aid and legal services organizations. Depending upon the structure of the organization, the entire organization or different components of it may constitute a firm or firms for purposes of these Rules.

## Oasis West Realty v. Goldman (Cal. 2011)

Early 2004 Oasis embarked on a plan to redevelop and revitalize a nine-acre parcel it owned in Beverly Hills by erecting a 5 star hotel and luxury condos. The Hilton project required the approval of the Beverly Hills City Council.

Oasis retained defendant Kenneth Goldman and his firm defendant Reed Smith.

According to the engagement letter, Goldman was to have “overall responsibility for this matter.”

Oasis hired him because he was an expert in civic matters and a well-respected influential leader extremely active in Beverly Hills politics. Oasis believed that Goldman held sway and influence on City Council and on members of the Southwest Homeowners Assoc of which he was President.

During representation, Goldman becomes “intimately involved in the formulation of the plan for Oasis’s development, its overall strategy to obtain public support for the Project. Goldman was a key Oasis representative in dealing with Beverly Hills City Officials including the Planning Commission and City Council. 

Oasis revealed confidences to Goldman which it believed would be held forever inviolate.

April 2006 - Goldman advised Oasis that he and Reed Smith would no longer represent Oasis in connection with the project. Paid $60k in fees. [CLICK]

June 2006 Oasis’s development proposal was presented to the city council, after the representation had ended. For two years, the council and the city’s olanning commission reviewed thousands of pages of technical studies, held hearings and received input from community members.


The Committee forms And what does the Committee want to do? (to put a referendum on the ballot that would allow voters to overturn the city council’s approval of the Hilton project.)

Lo and behold Goldman lent his support to the project.

what does it mean?  page 395 (3rd)

"utmost good faith" (literally, "most abundant faith"). It is the name of a legal doctrine which governs insurance contracts. This means that all parties to an insurance contract must deal in good faith, making a full declaration of all material facts in the insurance proposal.

## Cascades Branding Innovation v. Walgreens (N.D. Ill. 2012) 

Patent infringement suit.

Cascades Branding is the exclusive licensee of the patent in suit, the “395” patent.

Plaintiff Cascades Branding is wholly owned by Cascades Ventures which in turn is wholly owned by Anthony O. Brown.

Do we consider Cascades Branding and Cascades Ventures one and the same?

Cascades branding has a patent (the 395 patent) related to improvements in mobile devices allowing them to find products and services in their vicinity. Best Buy and Target each have an app that does this.

Plaintiff Cascades Branding claims this infringes on the 395 patent.

Best Buy is represented by Robbins Kaplan, specifically Emmet J. McMahon who has appeared pro hac vice on Best Buy’s behalf.

THE ALLEGED FORMER REPRESENTATIONS

(1)

In 2010, Brown (co-owner of Cascades Ventures) approached Robbins Kaplan partner Ronald J. Schulz seeking representation for Cascades Ventures about licensing and enforcement of the Elbrus Portfolio (unrelated to the 395 patent). They exchanged emails.

Schulz DECLINED to represent Cascades and informally notified him of this. Closed file on May 20 2011 and formally notified.

Did Brown and Schulz form an atty-client relationship at that time?

Parties agree no atty-client relationship formed but DISPUTE whether Schulz learned confidential information that could help Best Buy in the current litigation.

(2)

Several years ago, Schutz and McMahon represented a company called TechSearch LLC which Brown cofounded and headed as President until he sold it. Shutz and McMahon helped litigate two lawsuits related to the Chan Portfolio. 

Cascades contends that through the TWO INTERACTIONS Robbins Kaplan has gained privileged information relating to Brown’s and thus Cascade Branding’s litigation strategy, business model, and approach to negotiating settlements and licenses.


## Rule 1.7 Corporate Families

> Comment 34:  “Lawyer who represents a corporation . . . does NOT . . . necessarily represent any . . .  parent or subsidiary.” 
> “Lawyer for an organization is not barred from accepting representation adverse to an affiliate in an unrelated matter, unless the circumstances are such that the affiliate should also be considered a client of the lawyer . . .”


## Model Rule 1.7, comment 34

Some circumstances might make the affiliate, as well as the represented entity, the client of the lawyer.  These include: 
(1) significant control of the nonclient by the client; 
(2) financial loss or benefit to the nonclient that will have a direct, adverse impact on the client; and 
(3) disclosure of confidential information of the nonclient entity.  Any or all of these might suffice to create an implied client-lawyer relationship with the affiliate.

reasonable impression that it is recommending the lawyer, is making the referral without 
payment from the lawyer, or has analyzed a person’s legal problems when determining which 
lawyer should receive the referral. See also Rule 5.3 for the (duties of lawyers and law firms

## Model Rule 7.3 Solicitation of Clients

>A lawyer shall not by in-person, live telephone or real-time electronic contact solicit professional employment . . . 

Solicitation. The most important change here is almost a TERMINOLOGY CONSIDERATION

Ethics 20/20 Commission  wanted this changed to SOLICITATION OF CLIENTS.

As we’ll see very quickly the term PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS is now almost a term of art 

and is confined to Rule 1.18

dealing with CONSULTATION of prospective clients. 


## Model Rule 7.3(a) Solicitation of Clients

<!-- See Slide 100 -->

> A lawyer shall not 
> by in‑person, live telephone  or real-time electronic contact
> solicit professional employment 
> (for pecuniary gain) 
> unless the person contacted:
> (1) is a lawyer; or
> (2) has a family, close personal, or prior professional relationship with the lawyer.

I hate putting this much text on the screen, but since we’re here, why not refresh our knowledge.

(A) deals with what might be called direct, real-time solicitation.

The rule works pretty well even in the context of social media.

------

[1]  A solicitation is a targeted communication initiated by the lawyer that is directed to a specific person and that offers to provide, or can reasonably be understood as offering to provide, legal services.  In contrast, a lawyer’s communication typically does not constitute a solicitation if it is directed to the general public, such as through a billboard, an Internet banner advertisement, a website or a television commercial, or if it is in response to a request for information or is automatically generated in response to Internet searches. 
[2]  There is a potential for abuse when a solicitation involves direct in‑person, live telephone or real-time electronic contact by a lawyer with someone known to need legal services. These forms of contact subject a person to the private importuning of the trained advocate in a direct interpersonal encounter. The person, who may already feel overwhelmed by the circumstances giving rise to the need for legal services, may find it difficult fully to evaluate all available alternatives with reasoned judgment and appropriate self‑interest in the face of the lawyer's presence and insistence upon being retained immediately. The situation is fraught with the possibility of undue influence, intimidation, and over‑reaching.
[3]  This potential for abuse inherent in direct in-person, live telephone or real-time electronic solicitation justifies its prohibition, particularly since lawyers have alternative means of conveying necessary information to those who may be in need of legal services. In particular, communications can be mailed or transmitted by email or other electronic means that do not involve real-time contact and do not violate other laws governing solicitations.  These forms of communications and solicitations make it possible for the public to be informed about the need for legal services, and about the qualifications of available lawyers and law firms, without subjecting the public to direct in-person, telephone or real-time electronic persuasion that may overwhelm a person’s judgment.
[4]  The use of general advertising and written, recorded or electronic communications to transmit information from lawyer to the public, rather than direct in‑person, live telephone or real-time electronic contact, will help to assure that the information flows cleanly as well as freely. The contents of advertisements and communications permitted under Rule 7.2 can be permanently recorded so that they cannot be disputed and may be shared with others who know the lawyer. This potential for informal review is itself likely to help guard against statements and claims that might constitute false and misleading communications, in violation of Rule 7.1. The contents of direct in‑person, live telephone or real-time electronic contact can be disputed and may not be subject to third‑party scrutiny. Consequently, they are much more likely to approach (and occasionally cross) the dividing line between accurate representations and those that are false and misleading.
[5]  There is far less likelihood that a lawyer would engage in abusive practices against a former client, or a person with whom the lawyer has a close personal or family relationship, or in situations in which the lawyer is motivated by considerations other than the lawyer's pecuniary gain. Nor is there a serious potential for abuse when the person contacted is a lawyer. Consequently, the general prohibition in Rule 7.3(a) and the requirements of Rule 7.3(c) are not applicable in those situations. Also, paragraph (a) is not intended to prohibit a lawyer from participating in constitutionally protected activities of public or charitable legal- service organizations or bona fide political, social, civic, fraternal, employee or trade organizations whose purposes include providing or recommending legal services to their members or beneficiaries.
[6]  But even permitted forms of solicitation can be abused. Thus, any solicitation which contains information which is false or misleading within the meaning of Rule 7.1, which involves coercion, duress or harassment within the meaning of Rule 7.3(b)(2), or which involves contact with someone who has made known to the lawyer a desire not to be solicited by the lawyer within the meaning of Rule 7.3(b)(1) is prohibited. Moreover, if after sending a letter or other communication as permitted by Rule 7.2 the lawyer receives no response, any further effort to communicate with the recipient of the communication may violate the provisions of Rule 7.3(b).
[7]  This Rule is not intended to prohibit a lawyer from contacting representatives of organizations or groups that may be interested in establishing a group or prepaid legal plan for their members, insureds, beneficiaries or other third parties for the purpose of informing such entities of the availability of and details concerning the plan or arrangement which the lawyer or lawyer's firm is willing to offer. This form of communication is not directed to people who are seeking legal services for themselves. Rather, it is usually addressed to an individual acting in a fiduciary capacity seeking a supplier of legal services for others who may, if they choose, become prospective clients of the lawyer. Under these circumstances, the activity which the lawyer undertakes in communicating with such representatives and the type of information transmitted to the individual are functionally similar to and serve the same purpose as advertising permitted under Rule 7.2.
[8]  The requirement in Rule 7.3(c) that certain communications be marked "Advertising Material" does not apply to communications sent in response to requests of potential clients or their spokespersons or sponsors. General announcements by lawyers, including changes in personnel or office location, do not constitute communications soliciting professional employment from a client known to be in need of legal services within the meaning of this Rule.
[9]  Paragraph (d) of this Rule permits a lawyer to participate with an organization which uses personal contact to solicit members for its group or prepaid legal service plan, provided that the personal contact is not undertaken by any lawyer who would be a provider of legal services through the plan. The organization must not be owned by or directed (whether as manager or otherwise) by any lawyer or law firm that participates in the plan. For example, paragraph (d) would not permit a lawyer to create an organization controlled directly or indirectly by the lawyer and use the organization for the in‑person or telephone solicitation of legal employment of the lawyer through memberships in the plan or otherwise. The communication permitted by these organizations also must not be directed to a person known to need legal services in a particular matter, but is to be designed to inform potential plan members generally of another means of affordable legal services. Lawyers who participate in a legal service plan must reasonably assure that the plan sponsors are in compliance with Rules 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3(b). See 8.4(a).


## Model Rule 7.3(b)

<!-- See Slide 101 -->

> A lawyer shall not 
> solicit professional employment 
> by written, recorded or electronic communication 
> or by in‑person, telephone or real-time electronic contact 
> even when not otherwise prohibited by paragraph (a), if:
> the prospective client target of the solicitation has made known to the lawyer a desire not to be solicited by the lawyer; or
> the solicitation involves coercion, duress or harassment.

(B) deals with all communications including those prohibited by (A)

if the target of the solicitation is telling the lawyer PLEASE GO AWAY

--------

[3]  This potential for abuse inherent in direct in-person, live telephone or real-time electronic solicitation justifies its prohibition, particularly since lawyers have alternative means of conveying necessary information to those who may be in need of legal services. In particular, communications can be mailed or transmitted by email or other electronic means that do not involve real-time contact and do not violate other laws governing solicitations.  These forms of communications and solicitations make it possible for the public to be informed about the need for legal services, and about the qualifications of available lawyers and law firms, without subjecting the public to direct in-person, telephone or real-time electronic persuasion that may overwhelm a person’s judgment.


## Model Rule 7.3(c) Solicitation of Clients

Advertising Material


(c) Every written, recorded or electronic communication from a lawyer soliciting professional employment from anyone known to be in need of legal services in a particular matter shall include the words "Advertising Material" on the outside envelope, if any, and at the beginning and ending of any recorded or electronic communication, unless the recipient of the communication is a person specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2).

[8]  The requirement in Rule 7.3(c) that certain communications be marked "Advertising Material" does not apply to communications sent in response to requests of potential clients or their spokespersons or sponsors. 

General announcements by lawyers, including changes in personnel or office location, do not constitute communications soliciting professional employment from a client known to be in need of legal services within the meaning of this Rule.


## Model Rule 7.3 New Comment 1

> A solicitation is a targeted communication initiated by the lawyer that is directed _to a specific person_ and that offers to provide . . . legal services. 

> In contrast, a lawyer’s communication . . . does not constitute a solicitation if it is directed to the general public . . . 

New Comment 1 continued:

I began my career working for five years at Bryan Cave’s St. Louis office.

This is Dave Slavkin, friend, mentor, also one of the firm’s ethics experts. 

So let’s say I am a prospective client and I would like to CONSULT with DAVE by sending him an email [CLICK] because I see that he is an expert in fiduciary litigation.

SO in the OLD DAYS, this is what would happen. My browser launches an email form. [CLICK]



## Slide 107

[Screen-Shot of an E-mail Message]

Now I can attach privileged or confidential documents, I can tell Dave the story of my life including gobs of confidential info.

Dave may have another client DIRECTLY ADVERSE TO ME, but even if he does his DUTIES TO ME AS A PROSPECTIVE CLIENT MAY BE TRIGGERED IF A CONSULTATION HAS OCCURRED

HOW DO WE KNOW IF IT HAS OCCURRED?

if DAVE

either in person or through the lawyer’s advertising in any medium

specifically requests or invites the submission of information about a potential representation 

without clear and reasonably understandable warnings . . . 

that limit the lawyer’s obligations  

then a consultation MAY HAVE OCCURRED

So how to avoid this easy. Why not just provide the warnings no matter what?

## PROBLEM: Prospective Clients

__Problem 11-4__. Martyn & Fox received a call to defend a major accounting firm in a 10b-5 class action involving a dot.com company whose stock has precipitously dropped. The accounting firm sent Fox the pleadings and Fox met with them for three hours yesterday, explaining the firm’s approach and the possible lines of defense the accounting firm might use. The firm promised to get back to Martyn & Fox next week. Today, Martyn circulated a conflicts memo asking whether the firm could take on the representation of the defendant underwriter in the same matter. What should Fox do?

__Rules__: MR 1.0(k), 1.10, 1.18; RLGL §15

__Readings__: None

__Result__: Martyn & Fox cannot take on the underwriter unless both the accounting firm and the underwriter give consent to the representation.  

BECAUSE FOX DID NOT REASONABLY LIMIT THE INITIAL EXPOSURE TO THE PROSPECTIVE CLIENT, SCREENING FOX WILL NOT CURE THE PROBLEM.

__Reflections__: This all too real problem permits students to explore new MR 1.18.  The law firm is asked to participate in a “BEAUTY CONTEST.”  The law firm meets with the prospective client for hours.  It, by definition, wishes to strut out its best stuff.  Students (perhaps by role playing that might involve two teams of students competing to represent the accounting firm) should recognize what has often been called the “drool factor”; i.e., a law firm’s excited and expansive approach to the opportunity to take on a challenging and lucrative engagement like this. 
 
Confidential information—almost by definition—is shared.  No decision has been made.  And suddenly the firm is presented with a second (and certain) representation of a codefendant.

First, students might be pushed to reflect on whether any duties are owed to these “shopping accountants.”  They have not retained the firm; they have not paid a dime; they picked our brains; now the firm has not a chance but a certainty to represent a client who has not put the firm through this unseemly drill.  

Yet, even if students can be convinced to trash the prospective client, the class must recognize that duties are owed to all prospective clients.  

A profitable class discussion can focus on how the law firm might have protected itself in advance of the meeting by (a) urging the prospective client not to share any confidential information or (b) receiving assurances that, whatever was shared in the initial meeting, the prospective client would not use that disclosure to disqualify the law firm from representing other codefendants if the firm failed to win the contest.  

With respect to the latter, students should recognize how easy it is to discuss such a solution in principle, but how hard it is to implement in practice.  On the threshold of a splendid representation, does the law firm want to discuss what happens if it “loses” and tell this potential client how willing it is to represent another codefendant if this one does not pan out?

Now, having recognized the risks inherent when participating in “unprotected” beauty contests, students will be prepared to address new MR 1.18.  This rule has two components.  First, it reminds lawyers of duties owed to prospective clients, duties well established in the case law but never expressed in the rules.  Second, it provides that conversations with a prospective client will not disqualify a law firm from taking on a conflicting representation so long as (a) the lawyers who talked to the prospective client took reasonable precautions to engage in “safe” conversations, i.e., learned no more than was necessary to determine whether the firm could take on the representation, and (b) the lawyer or lawyers who engaged in the discussions are “screened” from the subsequent representation.  Then, students will want to consider whether the lawyers in the beauty contest problem are able to bring themselves under the protection of the new Rule.  

This is also a chance to begin the class’ consideration of the screening concept.  What is a screen?  Does it really protect a client’s (or a prospective client’s) confidential information?  How is it enforced?  How will the client (or prospective client) know it has been breached?  Should we ask clients (or prospective clients) to simply accept a screen, as MR 1.18 does?  

<!-- Slide 112 follows, see slide for diagram -->

Fox met with accounting firm for 3 hours, reviewed pleadings and explained the firm’s approach and the possible lines of defense the accounting firm might use

Martyn circulates a conflicts memo asking whether the firm could take on the representation of the defendant underwriter in the same matter. 

<!-- Slide 113 follows, see slide for diagram -->

__Result__: Martyn & Fox cannot take on the underwriter unless both the accounting firm and the underwriter give consent to the representation. 

May we screen Fox [CLICK]

How firm protect itself?

Consider the CYNICAL USE of this. Suppose the accounting firm wants to make sure 

Fox met with accounting firm for 3 hours,
 reviewed pleadings and explained the firm’s approach 
and the possible lines of defense the accounting firm might use

Martyn circulates a conflicts memo asking whether 
the firm could take on the representation 
of the defendant underwriter in the same matter. 

__Rules__: MR 1.0(k), 1.10, 1.18; RLGL § 15

__ Readings__: ABA Formal Opinion 10-457; Cascades Branding Innovation, LLC v. Walgreen
Co.

__Result__: Martyn & Fox cannot take on the underwriter unless both the accounting firm and the underwriter give consent to the representation. Because Fox did not reasonably limit the initial exposure to the prospective client, screening Fox will not cure the problem.

__Reflections__: This all too real problem permits students to explore MR 1.18. The ABA Opinion and Cascades should help them with the analysis. The law firm is asked to participate in a “beauty contest.” 

The law firm meets with the prospective client for hours. It, by definition, wishes to strut out its best stuff. Students (perhaps by role playing that involves two teams of students competing to represent the accounting firm) should recognize what has often been called the “drool factor”; i.e., a law firm’s excited and expansive approach to the opportunity to take on a challenging and lucrative engagement like this. Confidential information—almost by definition—is shared. No decision has been made. And suddenly the firm is presented with a second (and certain) representation of a co-defendant. The ABA Opinion illustrates how the same thing can happen in cyberspace.

First, students might be pushed to reflect on whether any duties are owed to these “shopping accountants.” They have not retained the firm; they have not paid a dime; they picked our brains; now the firm has not a chance but a certainty to represent a client who has not put the firm through this unseemly drill. Yet, even if students can be convinced to trash the prospective client, the class must recognize that duties are owed to all prospective clients. 

A profitable class discussion can focus on how the law firm might have protected itself in advance of the meeting by 

(a) urging the prospective client not to share any confidential information or 

(b) receiving assurances that, whatever was shared in the initial meeting, the prospective client would not use that disclosure to disqualify the law firm from representing other co-defendants if the firm failed to win the contest. 

With respect to the latter, students should recognize how easy it is to discuss such a solution in principle, but how hard it is to implement in practice. On the threshold of a splendid representation, does the law firm want to discuss what happens if it “loses” and tell this potential client how willing it is to represent another co-defendant if this one does not pan out?

Now, having recognized the risks inherent when participating in “unprotected” beauty contests, students will be prepared to address MR 1.18. This rule has two components. First, it reminds lawyers of duties owed to prospective clients, duties well established in the case law analogizing to MR 1.9, such as Cascades. Second, it provides that conversations with a prospective client will not disqualify a law firm from taking on a conflicting representation so long as (a) the lawyers who talked to the prospective client took reasonable precautions to engage in “safe” conversations, i.e., learned no more than was necessary to determine whether the firm could take on the representation, and (b) the lawyer or lawyers who engaged in the discussions are “screened” from the subsequent representation. 
Comment 2, Rule 1.18
Moreover, a person who communicates with a lawyer for the purpose of disqualifying the lawyer is not a “prospective client.”

Then, students will want to consider whether the lawyers in the beauty contest problem are able to bring themselves under the protection of the new Rule. Query whether the recent change from “discuss” to “consult” in Rule 1.18 does anything to change it’s application.

This is also a chance to begin the class’ consideration of the screening concept. What is a screen? Does it really protect a client’s (or a prospective client’s) confidential information? How is it enforced? How will the client (or prospective client) know it has been breached? Should we ask clients (or prospective clients) to simply accept a screen, as MR 1.18 does?

## Rule 1.18 Duties To Prospective Clients

>(a) a person who consults with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship . . .

And of course when we are interviewing a client in these circumstances, they are what the rules call a PROSPECTIVE CLIENT.

A big gnarly rule. It prefigures 1.7 and 1.9


## Model Rule 7.3 Direct Contact With Prospective Clients Solicitation of Clients

#### Body 

(a) A lawyer shall not by in-person, live telephone or real-time electronic contact solicit professional employment from a prospective client when a significant motive for the lawyer's doing so is the lawyer's pecuniary gain, unless the person contacted:  
(1) is a lawyer; or 
(2) has a family, close personal, or prior professional relationship with the lawyer.

#### Presenter Notes: 

Direct Contact with Prospective Clients used to be the title of this one 

If the Ethics 20/20 Commission has their way it will be changed to SOLICITATION OF CLIENTS.

As we’ll see very quickly the term PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS is about to be confined to Rule 1.18 dealing with CONSULTATION of prospective clients. So to avoid confusion where as here we are really talking about soliciting the public or soliciting targeted groups of people who may one day be clients.

(a) A lawyer shall not by in-person, live telephone or real-time electronic contact, solicit
206 professional employment from a prospective client when a significant motive for the
207 lawyer's doing so is the lawyer's pecuniary gain, unless the person contacted:
208 (1) is a lawyer; or
209 (2) has a family, close personal, or prior professional relationship with the lawyer.


## PROBLEM: [. . .]

__Problem 11-5__. Small Co. asks Martyn & Fox to bring a huge fraud and RICO claim against Magna Co. Martyn circulates a conflicts memo. The next day she receives a call from her bankruptcy partner. “We represent Big Bank in a $600 million loan to Magna that is scheduled to close next Tuesday. I’ll tell the CEO right away, and we’ll be heroes.”

__Rules__: MR 1.18, 1.4(a)(3); RLGL §§ 15, 20
 
__Readings__: ABA Formal Opinion 10-457; Cascades Branding Innovation, LLC v. Walgreen Co.

__Result__: Martyn & Fox cannot tell Big Bank without Small Co.’s consent, but that may limit our representation of Big Bank in the loan transaction.

__Reflections__: The tension between offering broad confidentiality protection to one not yet a client and the desire to provide important information to a long-valued client in connection with a present representation is wrenching.
Here, as in the prior problem, Small Co. is not yet a client. Cascades and the ABA Opinion explain the importance of confidentiality duties to prospective clients. The lawyer in Anonymous used and disclosed this kind of information for the benefit of a current client; as did the lawyers in Perez, by disclosing one client’s information to a third party. Whether current client or prospective client, the lawyer must keep confidences.

Second, the class should explore whether Small Co. would “mind” if Martyn & Fox disclosed to Big Bank; the idea of securing Small Co.’s consent should be considered. What if Martyn & Fox does not get consent? Can they disclose anyway? Presumably Small Co. (a) will not want any disclosure to occur at this preliminary stage and (b) would be pleased to have Big Bank go ahead with the loan to ensure the liquidity of Magna Co. But now Martyn & Fox “knows” information extremely valuable to Big Bank. What if Big Bank goes forward with the loans and the lawsuit is brought two weeks later? What will Big Bank’s reaction be if it learns that fact and then concludes we let Big Bank go forward with the loan, when we knew a material fact unknown to the borrower and unknown to Big Bank?
Finally, since Martyn & Fox cannot disclose the Small Co. information, the class should consider whether there is any way the firm can represent Big Bank at the loan closing. Does merely acquiring this information mid-representation of Big Bank create a situation that requires Martyn & Fox to resign to avoid violating MR 1.4? This would allow Big Bank to be represented by a law firm that is free to explore the contingent liabilities of Magna Co. without violating the rules of professional conduct.

__Malpractice__: Flatt v. Super. Ct. of Sonoma Cnty., 885 P.2d 950 (Cal. 1994) (duty to keep prospective client’s confidences negates any duty to inform current client about material information; strong dissent). Hazard and Hodes, The Law of Lawyering (3d ed. Aspen 2001) has a good discussion of this case and issue in § 9.18.
__Discipline__: In re Anonymous, 932 N.E.2d 671 (Ind. 2010) (lawyer who referred prospective client to another lawyer in firm and several months later expressed “concern” for prospective client while socializing with friends privately reprimanded); N.J.

Y. City Bar Op. 2001-1 (prospective client’s disclosures on law firm’s website do not generally disqualify lawyer from representing another party in the same matter, but law firm must keep disclosures confidential).

## PROBLEM: Imputed Conflicts

__Problem 11-6__. Martyn & Fox is in a ten-day countdown to trial when one of its associates darkens Fox’s door to announce that she is leaving the firm on Friday. When Fox recovers from the shock of losing his right arm in the case on such short notice, the associate tells him that she will be joining the firm on the other side of the case, but not to worry — she’ll be screened. What should Martyn & Fox do?

__Rules__: MR 1.0(k), 1.9, 1.10; RLGL §124(2)

__Readings__: Mitchell v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.; “My Lawyer Switched Sides; Don’t Worry, There’s A Screen”

__Result__: Martyn & Fox should move to disqualify the opposing counsel.

__Reflections__: This problem is designed to explore screening provisions adopted by about half of the jurisdictions in former client conflicts situations.  

But before the debate over the rules governing imputation can be joined, the class should be forced to address whether this associate may withdraw from the REPRESENTATION UNDER MR 1.16.  

The class will undoubtedly be surprised that on the issue of associate withdrawal, this rule comes into play at all.  There is a notion out in the ether that, for associates, lawyer mobility trumps all.  But, in fact, an associate, perhaps more than the partner, cannot simply withdraw without cause when that withdrawal will have a serious adverse affect on the client, no matter how oppressive the associate’s work environment or slim her partnership prospects.

That aside, the class will want to discuss how this news is broken to the client and how distressed the client will be when the client learns it has not only been abandoned but its lawyer is now working for the adversary’s law firm, a firm the client’s firm has perhaps repeatedly observed cannot be trusted.  

Even if the firm is perfectly trustworthy, Larry’s story explores the problem of inadvertent screen breaches.  

Again, this is a perfect opportunity to explore what a screen means and whether the client here should take any comfort from the Revised Model Rules’ attempts to define a screen in MR 1.0.  

__Rules__: MR 1.0(k), 1.9, 1.10; RLGL § 124(2) Readings: Martin v. Atlanticare; “My Lawyer Switched Sides; Don’t Worry, There’s A
Screen”

__Result__: Martyn & Fox should move to disqualify the opposing counsel.

__Reflections__: This problem is designed to explore screening provisions adopted by about half of the jurisdictions in former-client conflicts situations. Martin illustrates a jurisdiction where, despite a limited nonconsensual screening rule, the court finds just about everything wrong with the law firm’s reading of the rule and feeble attempts to implement an adequate screen.

But before the debate over the rules governing imputation can be joined, the class should be forced to address whether this associate may withdraw from the representation under MR 1.16. The class will undoubtedly be surprised that on the issue of associate withdrawal, this rule comes into play at all.

## Rule 1.16: Declining or Terminating Representation

> (b) Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer may withdraw from representing a client if:
> (1) withdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of the client . . . 
> (c) A lawyer must comply with applicable law requiring notice to or permission of a tribunal when terminating a representation . . . 

Client-Lawyer Relationship  Rule 1.16 Declining Or Terminating Representation

(a) Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer shall not represent a client or, where representation has commenced, shall withdraw from the representation of a client if:

(1) the representation will result in violation of the rules of professional conduct or other law;
(2) the lawyer's physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer's ability to represent the client; or
(3) the lawyer is discharged.

(b) Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer may withdraw from representing a client if:

(1) withdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of the client;
(2) the client persists in a course of action involving the lawyer's services that the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent;
(3) the client has used the lawyer's services to perpetrate a crime or fraud;
(4) the client insists upon taking action that the lawyer considers repugnant or with which the lawyer has a fundamental disagreement;
(5) the client fails substantially to fulfill an obligation to the lawyer regarding the lawyer's services and has been given reasonable warning that the lawyer will withdraw unless the obligation is fulfilled;
(6) the representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer or has been rendered unreasonably difficult by the client; or
(7) other good cause for withdrawal exists.

(c) A lawyer must comply with applicable law requiring notice to or permission of a tribunal when terminating a representation. When ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.

(d) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred. The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.






## PROBLEM: [. . .]

__Problem 11-7__. Martyn & Fox’s Berlin office represents Volkswagen in a dispute with Chrysler. Under rules applicable to German lawyers, screening of a lateral lawyer is permitted to lift imputation; under the rules applicable to Martyn & Fox in New York, no screening is permitted. Should Martyn & Fox be disqualified?


__Rules__: MR 1.0(k), 8.5
 
__Readings__: Practice Pointers: Implementing a Conflicts Control System 

__Result__: Probably.

__Reflections__: There is a nice ambiguity built in this problem. 

Was a German lawyer retained by Martyn & Fox to work on the matter? Or is the German lawyer a partner or an associate at Martyn & Fox? 

The former gives the students an opportunity to discuss imputation across firm lines. When will conflicts of one lawyer be imputed to co-counsel? The issue calls to mind Problem 9-17 and the question of whether a lawyer might end up disqualified from a matter because another lawyer, also a signatory to a joint defense agreement, is disqualified for a conflict of interest.

Assuming the lawyer became a lawyer at Martyn & Fox, the questions now are (a) do we impute across national boundaries and (b) if we do, can we argue that because screening may remove imputation in Germany, it can also do so in Martyn & Fox’s home jurisdiction where screening is not authorized? One might assert that the original German client of the new lawyer is not entitled to any greater protection than the client would receive in Germany. However, given that the Martyn & Fox lawyers, whose role is being challenged, practice in a jurisdiction that does not authorize this device and they are appearing in a court that does not recognize involuntary screening, the argument that the German screening rule should be given trans-Atlantic effect is quite weak indeed.


## PROBLEM: Imputed Conflicts

__Problem 11-8__. Martyn & Fox agrees to staff a hot line for the local legal services project every Tuesday. One Tuesday a Martyn & Fox associate received a phone call from an individual who has been the subject of predatory lending by The Dollar Store. Without seeing any documents, the associate gave the woman advice about possible remedies and only learned upon returning to the firm that Big Bank, Martyn & Fox’s largest client, owns The Dollar Store. Is Martyn & Fox in trouble?

__Rules__: MR 1.7, 1.10, 6.5  

__Readings__: Lawyers and Clients: Service Pro Bono Publico p. 66

__Result__: Martyn & Fox can breathe freely if MR 6.5 has been adopted in their jurisdiction.

__Reflections__: If Dollar Store is a client, Associate has just represented one client whose interests are directly adverse to another client in the same matter.  Under MR 1.10, clients of the firm are clients of the lawyer.  Again the class is presented with a recent change in the Model Rules.  MR 6.5 permits lawyers who assist in hotlines or help desks at public service practice settings to provide limited advice to clients so long as no conflict is apparent to the lawyer undertaking the assignment.  No databases need be searched; no conflicts memoranda need be circulated.  Unless on its face the lawyer recognizes a conflict, the lawyer can provide the limited advice in order to facilitate this service in the public interest.  A class discussion on whether this new provision represents enlightened public policy or compromises core values for those least able to protect themselves may prove quite worthwhile.

## Martin v. Atlanticare (D. N.J. 2011)

<!-- Diagrams on Slide 124-25 -->

After Lawyer Lisa Grosskruetz did substantial defense work on this case while employed by defendant’s law firm Morgan Lewis Bockius (“Morgan”) she left Morgan and went to work for plaintiff’s law firm, Costello & Mains, P.C.

Question is LG disqualified?  [YES and LG agrees]

Question is whether Costello & Mains should be disqualified because it employed a side-switching atty?

The New Jersey screening rule is different than Model Rule 1.10. 

NJ RPC is found at p. 411 (M&F 3rd) 

Imputation cannot be cured by screening if the personally disqualified lawyer had “primary responsibility” for the representation.

Court analyzes Lisa Grosskreutz’s participation and finds that she put in twice as many hours as the other two lawyers combined.

True Richard Rosenblatt (RR)

EVen if LG did NOT have primary responsibility for the Atlanticare case, were the screening procedures adequate?

No! They were not in writing. She still had access to files. And the  

## Model Rule 1.12 Former Judge,  Arbitrator, Mediator or Other Third-Party Neutral (Dooling edits)

>(a) Like Rule 1.11 (“personally and substantially”) except as a judge, adjudicative officer, law clerk, arbitrator, mediator etc . . . UNLESS all parties to the proceeding give informed consent, confirmed in writing.
>(b) Judges, law clerks and other third-party neutrals shall not  negotiate for employment with persons who appear before them. (Law clerks may do so, but only AFTER they tell the judge.)
>(c) Imputation and screening, virtually the same as Rule 1.11.
>(d) An arbitrator selected as a partisan . . . in a multimember arbitration panel is not prohibited from subsequently representing that party. 


## PROBLEM: Mediators

__Problem 11-10__. Grayson, the senior partner at Martyn & Fox, has been mediating a dispute between Hydrogen Electric and Steel Company over electric rates for the year 2000. He finished facilitating the participants’ agreement last Tuesday. Now Martyn has been called by Steel Company to see if the firm will represent Steel Company against Hydrogen Electric for the year 2002 electric charges. May Martyn take the case?

#### Presenter Notes: 

__Rules__: MR 1.12, 1.9, 2.4

__Readings__: “My Lawyer Switched Sides; Don’t Worry, There’s A Screen”

__Result__: Yes, if Grayson is screened.

__Reflections__: This problem reflects a recent change in the Model Rules.  The question is whether the firm of a lawyer who serves as a mediator is thereafter free to represent either of the “mediated” parties in a substantially related matter.  
Appreciating the dilemma the question poses depends on students’ understanding the mediation process and, in particular, the mediator’s commitment to keep confidential what the mediator learns from the parties during the mediation. 
In Poly Software Intl. Inc., v. Su, 880 F. Supp. 1487 (D. Utah 1995), the Court found that mediators should be governed by MR 1.9’s substantial relationship test, as well as MR 1.12’s same matter test, because mediators receive significant confidential information. 

MR 1.12, on the other hand, governs lawyer-mediators by the same matter test alone, and allows screens of the mediator without the parties consent.

Once students recognize that foundation, a lively class discussion might ensue.  Is mediation in general and mediation practice in particular so important that screening should be allowed to encourage lawyers to engage in it?  Or, should mediators be more concerned with public acceptance of confidentiality in mediation and welcome a Poly Software kind of analysis?  

Again, students must confront the screening concept; so must the party to the mediation that now finds itself opposing the law firm of the mediator with whom it may have entrusted more sensitive information than the prospective client in the previous problem.  This rule, MR 1.12, was originally intended to apply to judges who, almost by definition, learn nothing confidential.  Its extension to mediators, who almost by definition do, is a controversial topic worthy of an animated class discussion.

__Result__: Yes, if Grayson is screened.
