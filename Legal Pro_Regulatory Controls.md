# REGULATORY CONTROLS OVER ATTORNEYS AND UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE

---

## GENERAL SOURCES OF REGULATION
_Practice within state courts is regulated by the courts, legislature, and bar of each state. Practice
in the federal courts is regulated by the rules of each district court and circuit court of appeals,
rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of the United States, and rules passed by Congress._

### State Regulation
__State Legislatures__.<br />
The relative powers of the legislature and courts of a state with respect to regulation of the legal profession have never been clearly defined through legislation or case law. It is generally assumed that the legislature establishes standards as aids to the judicial branch, but that the courts may fashion more stringent rules.

__State Courts__.<br />
The inherent authority to regulate practice within the courts of a state is vested in the
___highest court___ of the jurisdiction. Final decision-making power with respect to such regulation is usually assumed by these courts.

__State Bar Associations__.<br />
Two general classes of state bar associations can be distinguished: integrated bar associations and voluntary bar associations. Integrated bar associations require all attorneys within the state to join and thereby subject themselves to the rules promulgated by the association. They are usually formed under the authority of state legislatures, state courts, or in some cases, by the state courts under general powers and instructions created by the state legislature. Voluntary bar associations do not encompass the entire community of practicing lawyers within a state unless they all voluntarily join. Still, these voluntary associations have often been in the forefront of proposing ethical standards and attempting to regulate the unauthorized practice of law.

### Federal Regulation
__Federal Courts__.<br />
Each federal district and appellate court promulgates its own rules independent of those
that exist for the state courts in the jurisdiction where the federal court sits.

- __Requirements for Admission__. <br />
Most federal courts require only that the attorney seeking admission be a member of the bar of the state in which the court sits and make formal application for admission to the federal bar.

- __Interstate Federal Practice__.<br />
Under limited circumstances, an attorney who is a member of the bar in one state and admitted to practice before a federal court in that state may be permitted to appear in a federal court in another state.

 - __“Pro Hac Vice” Appearances__.<br /> 
An attorney who is a member of the bar in one state may be allowed to appear “pro hac vice” in federal court in another state to argue or try a particular case. In such instances, the state in which the federal court sits cannot limit the attorney’s rights.  
> _Example_: An attorney who specializes in antitrust law and is a member of the bar in State A appears in federal court in State B on a complex antitrust matter. State B cannot limit the attorney’s right to practice in federal court on the ground that he is not licensed to practice in State B.

  - __Continuous Federal Practice__.<br />
A different result is reached when an attorney attempts to conduct a full-time federal practice within a state in which he has not been admitted to the bar. Under such circumstances the state is fully within its rights in limiting the attorney’s access to the courts even though he has limited himself exclusively to federal matters.

__Federal Administrative Agencies__.<br />
In most instances, the only requirement for practice before a federal administrative agency is that the attorney be a member of the bar of the state in which the agency sits. Certain specialized agencies, such as the United States Patent Office, also require that
the attorney pass a special examination to test his expertise. In addition, it has been recognized that federal law may totally preempt an area in such a manner so as to allow anyone who meets specific qualifications to practice law in that field regardless of whether he is admitted to practice in a particular jurisdiction.
> _Example_: An attorney or nonlawyer “agent” may be admitted to practice law before the Patent Office provided he has passed a special examination. A state cannot prohibit a qualified patent agent from practicing patent law in that state on the basis that he is not admitted to that state’s bar and is thereby engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. [_Sperry v. State of Florida ex rel. Florida Bar_, 373 U.S. 379 (1963)] 

Most federal administrative agencies have a procedure whereby an attorney may be suspended or disbarred from practice before the agency.

__Federal Government Attorneys__.<br />
A federal government attorney is subject to state ***ethics*** laws and rules (as well as local federal court rules) governing attorney conduct in each state in which the attorney engages in her duties. [28 U.S.C. §530B(a); 28 C.F.R. §§77.2, .3]

### American Bar Association

The American Bar Association (“ABA”) is a voluntary national organization which, since its inception, has performed many important advisory functions relating to the regulation of the legal profession, including promulgating the Model Rules of Professional Conduct (“RPC”), which have been adopted by a majority of states. Note that in 2002, the ABA revised the Model Rules, and this outline is based on the Rules as revised.

## ADMISSION TO THE LEGAL PROFESSION

In regulating admission to practice, each jurisdiction has formulated certain prerequisites. While the details of satisfying these will vary by state and federal district, the applicant normally must meet educational requirements, pass (except where waived if from another jurisdiction) a bar examination, and show that she is a person of good moral character. To satisfy constitutional standards of equal protection of the laws, any prerequisite to admission must bear a ***rational relationship*** to the applicant’s fitness or capacity. [_Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners of New Mexico_, 353 U.S. 232 (1957)]

### Citizenship Requirements

A state may not require that an applicant be a citizen of the United States. [_In re Griffiths_, 413 U.S. 717 (1973)]

### Residency Requirements

State residency requirements for bar admission violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution. [*Supreme Court of New Hampshire v. Piper*, 470 U.S. 274(1985)]
> *Rationale*: The right to practice law is a “fundamental” right. States may discriminate against nonresidents only where their reasons are ***substantial*** and the difference in treatment bears a close or ***substantial relation*** to those reasons.

- **Admission on Motion**.<br />
A state residency requirement for admission to the state’s bar without examination (on motion) is unconstitutional. Requiring nonresidents to sit for a bar examination while residents may be admitted on motion violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause. [*Supreme Court of Virginia v. Friedman*, 487 U.S. 59 (1988)]

- **Residency for Federal Court Practice**.<br />
The Supreme Court has also struck down a local rule of a federal district court that required, in addition to bar membership in the state in which the court sits, that applicants to the court’s bar also live or maintain an office in that state. The Court found this requirement unnecessary and irrational. [*Frazier v. Heebe*, 482 U.S. 641 (1987)]

### Character Requirements

Every jurisdiction places on each applicant the burden of showing that he possesses “good
moral character.”

- **Applicant’s Procedure**.<br />
Each applicant is usually required to answer a detailed background questionnaire and to furnish references. The refusal to furnish such information is grounds for rejection of the applicant.
> *Example*: An applicant who refuses to answer questions concerning his possible membership in the Communist Party may be rejected because such inquiries are merely a prelude to an investigation into his moral character. [*Konigsberg v. State Bar of California*, 366 U.S. 36 (1961)]

- **Procedural Protections**.<br />
An applicant is entitled to procedural due process with regard to actions taken by the bar representatives reviewing his application. This includes the right to a ***hearing*** before the bar committee and ***confrontation of adverse witnesses***, as well as the right to ***judicial review*** of the denial of an application based on bad moral character. [*Willner v. Committee on Character and Fitness*, 373 U.S. 96 (1963)]

- **Conduct Failing the “Good Moral Character” Test**.<br />
The purpose of the bar committee’s investigation into the background of an applicant is to determine if there is anything in his past that reflects adversely upon his honesty and integrity. The general benchmark used to measure this is whether any of the applicant’s past conduct involved “moral turpitude,” i.e., acts that involve intentional dishonesty or are repugnant to accepted moral standards. Any conduct or charges against the applicant involving such crimes as bribery, perjury, theft, murder, rape, etc., would fall within the definition of “moral turpitude,” but a variety of illegal acts, such as draft evasion and possession of marijuana for personal use, may or may not be acts involving “moral turpitude,” depending upon the nature of the offense and the intent of the individual.
> *Example*: An applicant who had used aliases to hide his Jewish background from employers and who had been arrested along with other discontented laborers was found not to have committed an act of “moral turpitude.” [*Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners of New Mexico*, *supra*]

- **Constitutional Limitations on Regulatory Authorities**.<br />
Although a state regulatory agency may establish criteria that must be met by persons seeking admission to practice law within the state, there must be a nexus between the requirements for admission and an applicant’s fitness to practice law. For instance, the state regulatory authority may not reject an applicant solely because of ***membership in a political organization***, as opposed to active and knowing participation in the organization with the intent to advance specific goals. <br /> <br />
Nor may rejection be based on the ***personal beliefs*** of an applicant where those beliefs are not translated into an illegal advocacy to action. In this context, the Supreme Court rulings in bar admission proceedings have tracked the development of standards for the invocation of free speech and associational rights under the First Amendment.
> *Example*: An applicant may not be rejected merely on the basis of his membership in the Communist Party where there is no showing that he ever engaged in, or even advocated, actions to overthrow the government by force or violence. [*Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners of New Mexico*, *supra*]

* **Attorney’s Duty to Cooperate with Character Investigations**.<br />
An ***applicant*** for admission to the bar, or an ***attorney*** in connection with a bar admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter, must not: (i) knowingly make a false statement of material fact; or (ii) fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority. This rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by RPC 1.6 (relating to confidentiality). [RPC 8.1]

---

## DISCIPLINARY PROCESS

### General Substantive Standards

The Model Rules list six general prohibitions, the violation of which may, as do violations of the specific prohibitions in the Rules, lead to disciplinary measures. Under these prohibitions, a lawyer may not:

1. Violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or use the acts of another to commit a violation;

2. Commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects;

3. State or imply an ability to improperly influence a government agency or official or to achieve results by means that violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law;

4. Engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation;

5. Engage in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice; or

6. Knowingly assist a judge or judicial officer in conduct that violates applicable rules of judicial conduct or other law.

[RPC 8.4]

### Disciplinary Procedure

While the details of disciplinary procedure vary from state to state, there is a general procedural scheme along the following lines:

- **Complaint**.<br />
The disciplinary proceeding is initiated by a complaint to the state bar, which may be filed by a dissatisfied client, a member of the bar, or any other interested party. The filing of a complaint is generally considered a ***privileged communication*** and the complainant is usually protected from subsequent action by the attorney for defamation or malicious prosecution as a matter of public policy.

- **Screening and Hearing**.
The complaint will be examined in a preliminary screening process conducted by a panel appointed by the grievance committee of the state bar.

	- **Commencement of Hearing**.<br />
If a decision is made to pursue the complaint, a nonpublic hearing will usually be held before the grievance committee after notice to the attorney under investigation.

	- **Procedural Protections**.<br />
The Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and relevant state constitutions are applicable to state disciplinary proceedings. Thus, while the specific procedures vary by jurisdiction, a lawyer subject to a disciplinary hearing retains the basic ***rights to counsel and to cross-examination of witnesses*** at the hearing. [*In re Ruffalo*, 390 U.S. 544 (1968)] He also has the absolute right to invoke, without penalty, the Fifth Amendment ***protection against self-incrimination*** under the Supreme Court’s ruling in *Spevack v. Klein*, 385 U.S. 511 (1967).

### Forms of Disciplinary Sanction

The most common penalties for engaging in unethical or unprofessional conduct are: 

- ***disbarment*** (permanent revocation of an attorney’s license); 
- ***suspension*** (temporary revocation of an attorney’s right to practice); and 
- ***public or private censure*** by the courts or bar associations.

### Effect of Disciplinary Action on Other Court Systems

Each state and federal court system is considered a separate, autonomous unit for discipline as well as admission of attorneys. Thus, disciplinary proceedings by the state courts located within the federal district have no binding effect on the attorney’s ability to practice before the federal courts in that district. Similarly, foreign state courts must make their own independent evaluation of an attorney’s conduct when he has been disciplined in a sister state. However, most states give some effect to the sister state’s determination during their own proceedings on the basis of “full faith and credit” or “comity.”

### Practice in Multiple States—Choice of Law

A lawyer is subject to the regulation of the state in which she is admitted, regardless of where her conduct occurs. The disciplinary authority of a state includes lawyers not admitted in the state who provide or offer to provide legal services in the state. Note that a lawyer may be disciplined in more than one state based on the same conduct. [RPC 8.5(a)]

* **Choice of Law**.<br />
A tribunal considering conduct connected with a matter pending before it will apply the Rules of Professional Conduct of the state in which it sits, unless the tribunal’s rules provide otherwise. Regarding any other conduct, the tribunal will apply: (i) the rules of the state in which the conduct occurs; or (ii) the rules of another state in which occurred the ***predominant effect*** of the conduct. A safe harbor is provided for a lawyer whose conduct conforms to the rules of a state in which the lawyer reasonably believes the predominant effect will occur. [RPC 8.5(b)] Thus, if the lawyer is reasonably mistaken about the place of predominant effect, she will not be subject to discipline under the rules of the state where the predominant effect actually occurs. Regarding conflicts of interest only, a lawyer and client may enter into a written agreement specifying the “predominant effect” jurisdiction—e.g., “Client and Lawyer anticipate that the predominant effect of the lawyer’s conduct will be in Ohio and agree that the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct and Ohio law relating to conflicts of interest should govern Lawyer’s work on this matter.” [RPC 8.5, comment 5]

## UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW

In addition to regulating the admission and discipline of lawyers, each jurisdiction has sought to prevent the unauthorized practice of law. This prohibition is predicated upon the public’s need for integrity and competence of those persons purporting to render “legal” services. It is not unauthorized practice, however, for a layperson to represent herself.

### Definition of Unauthorized Practice

The Rules do not attempt to set forth a single definition of those activities that constitute the unauthorized practice of law. They adopt instead a functional definition. The Rules do, however, prohibit a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction where doing so violates the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction or assisting another person in doing so. [RPC 5.5(a)]

### Limited Exception Where Professional Judgment Not Required

Where the professional judgment of a lawyer is not involved, nonlawyers such as court clerks, abstracters, and many government officials are authorized to engage in occupations even if they require a special knowledge of law in certain areas.

### Definition Applied to Specific Activities

The actual determination of what constitutes unauthorized practice has been left to the state supreme court. Some states have attempted to define the practice of law in connection with specific activities, but in large measure the distinctions between such practice and proper lay activities are based on the particular circumstances of each case.

- **Preparation of Documents**.<br />

	- **Real Estate Brokers**.<br />
Real estate brokers may not draft contracts but may fill in the blanks on standard contracts as long as separate fees are not charged for such services.

	- **Title Insurance and Escrow Companies**.<br />
Title insurance and escrow companies are permitted to fill in standardized mortgage and deed forms in certain jurisdictions but are restrained from doing so in others.

	- **Lay Tax Advisers**.<br />
In theory, lay tax advisers may not counsel individuals as to the legal implications of their conduct but may, if qualified (i.e., by accountancy training), prepare tax returns for clients.
> *Example*: Client goes to see his tax accountant to consult with him concerning tax shelters for his large income. The accountant
may not give advice to Client on tax shelters because such advice requires the professional judgment of a lawyer as to the legality of specific action under the tax laws.

   - **Estate Planners**.<br />
Estate planners may not draft wills or prepare plans for specific individuals but may disseminate general information to the public through commercial or noncommercial means.
> *Example*: An estate planner published a book entitled *How to Avoid Probate*, which was in effect a “do-it-yourself” probate kit. He was subsequently charged with practicing law without a license. The court ruled that he was merely disseminating information to the public to enable individuals to represent themselves. [*New York County Lawyers’ Association v. Dacey*, 287 N.Y.S.2d 422 (1967)]

- **Representation of Clients**.<br />

	- **Corporations**.<br />
Corporations, other than nonprofit legal service groups or recognized professional corporations, generally may not represent a client directly in judicial proceedings or provide representation through their attorney-employees.

	- **Collection Agencies**.<br />
Collection agencies in a number of jurisdictions may not bring suit directly to enforce a debt assigned to them for collection. However, a state statute defining debt collection as the practice of law, thus limiting debt collection activities to members of that state’s bar, was held to be an unconstitutional imposition on interstate commerce. [*National Revenue Corp. v. Violet*, 807 F.2d 285 (1st Cir. 1986)]

	- **Representation “In Propria Persona”**.<br />
Individuals (not corporations) have the right to represent themselves even if they are not attorneys.

### Multi-Jurisdictional Practice

A lawyer who is not licensed to practice in a state must not: 

- open a law office in that state,
- represent that she is admitted to practice in that state, or 
- establish a “systematic and continuous presence” in that state without becoming licensed there. 

[RPC 5.5]

- **Permissible Types of Temporary Multi-Jurisdictional Practice**.<br />
The nature of modern law and commerce requires many lawyers to practice across state lines. RPC 5.5(c) recognizes this fact and provides that if a lawyer is admitted to practice in one state, and is not disbarred or suspended from practice in any state, then she may provide legal services in a second state ***on a temporary basis*** in four situations:

	- **Association with Active Local Lawyer**.<br />
The out-of-state lawyer who is not admitted in a state may practice there on a temporary basis if she associates a local lawyer who actively participates in the matter. [RPC 5.5(c)(1)]
> *Example*: Attorney A is admitted to practice in Utah only, and she works for a law firm that regularly represents a nationwide labor union. The union is trying to organize workers in Arizona, and A is sent to Arizona to give legal advice to the union’s organizers. With the union’s consent, A associates local labor lawyer L and rents a temporary office near L’s office. L works actively with A in handling legal problems arising from the union’s organizing efforts. A’s temporary practice in Arizona is proper.

   - **Special Permission to Practice in Local Tribunal**.<br />
An out-of-state lawyer may request special permission from a local court, administrative agency, or other tribunal to handle a matter in that tribunal. [RPC 5.5(c) (2)] In a court, such permission is commonly called admission “pro hac vice,” which means admission for purposes of this matter only. An out-of-state lawyer who reasonably expects to be admitted pro hac vice may engage in preliminary activities in the state, such as meeting with clients, reviewing documents, and interviewing witnesses.

	- **Mediation or Arbitration Arising Out of Practice in Home State**.<br />
An out-of-state lawyer may mediate, arbitrate, or engage in another form of alternative dispute resolution in a state if her services arise out of, or are reasonably related to, her practice in the state in which she is admitted. [RPC 5.5(c)(3)]
> *Example*: Attorney A is admitted to practice in Utah only. She represents a Utah client in a contract dispute, and the contract states that all such disputes will be submitted to arbitration in Arizona. A may represent her client in the Arizona arbitration, and the same would be true of a mediation or other form of alternative dispute resolution.

   - **Other Temporary Practice Arising Out of Practice in Home State**.<br />
RPC 5.5(c)(4) is a catch-all category that permits an out-of-state lawyer to temporarily practice in a state if the practice is reasonably related to the lawyer’s homestate practice.
> *Example*: Lawyer L is admitted to practice in Utah only. She represents a Utah client that buys up and revitalizes run-down shopping centers.
That client asks L to travel to Arizona to negotiate with the owner of an Arizona shopping center and to draft a purchase agreement that will satisfy the owner and that will be valid under the law of Arizona. It would be proper for L to render those services in Arizona.

- **Permissible Types of Permanent Multi-Jurisdictional Practice**.<br />
A lawyer who is admitted in one jurisdiction, and who is not disbarred or suspended from practice in any jurisdiction, may provide legal services through an office or other systematic and continuous presence in a state in which she is not admitted in two narrowly limited situations:

	- **Lawyers Employed by Their Only Client**.<br />
Some lawyers are salaried employees of their only client (e.g., in-house corporate lawyers and lawyers employed by the government). They may set up a permanent office to render legal services to their employer in a state, even if they are not admitted to practice there. However, if they want to ***litigate*** a matter in that state, they must seek admission pro hac vice. [RPC 5.5(d)(1)]
> *Example*: Attorney A is admitted to practice in Maryland and Virginia. She is employed by General Motors (“GM”),  hich assigns her to be the legal advisor in a GM office in Arizona. A need not be admitted to practice in Arizona, but if she wants to represent GM in a suit pending in an Arizona court, she must seek admission pro hac vice.

	   - **Foreign Lawyers Advising on United States Law**.<br />
A foreign lawyer practicing under this rule (e.g., serving as in-house counsel for a corporation) ***may not directly advise*** her client on the law of a United States jurisdiction. Rather, she must consult with a lawyer who is licensed by the relevant jurisdiction and base any advice to her client on advice she obtains from the local lawyer.

	- **Legal Services Authorized by Federal or Local Law**.<br />
In rare instances, federal or local law authorizes a lawyer to practice a restricted branch of law in a state in which she is not otherwise admitted to practice. [RPC 5.5(d)(2)]
> *Example*: Lawyer L is admitted to practice law in New York, and she is admitted to prosecute patents in the United States Patent and
Trademark Office, which is located in Washington, D.C. When L “retired” and moved to Florida, she did not become a member of the Florida bar; rather, she set up a Florida practice that is limited to patent prosecution in the Patent and Trademark Office. L does not handle other patent matters, such as patent licensing or patent infringement, and she does not practice any other kind of law. L’s restricted practice in Florida is proper. [*See Sperry v. Florida*, 373 U.S. 379 (1963)]

- **Informing the Client**.<br />
An out-of-state lawyer who: practices on a temporary basis, is a salaried employee of his only client, or is authorized to practice by federal or local law may under some circumstances be required to inform the client that he is not licensed in the state; e.g., when the representation occurs primarily in the state where the lawyer is not licensed and requires knowledge of that state’s law. [RPC 5.5, comment 20]

- **Disciplinary Consequences of Multi-Jurisdictional Practice**.<br />
A lawyer who engages in multi-jurisdictional practice in a state is subject to that state’s disciplinary authority. [RPC 5.5, comment 19]

### Judges and Court Officers

Full-time judges and court officers (including clerks) may not practice law, nor may law students represent clients except where authorized to do so under the supervision of a licensed attorney.

### Lawyers Aiding Lay Practitioners
A lawyer may not practice law in association with, or otherwise share fees with, a layperson and may be disciplined for aiding a nonlawyer in the unauthorized practice of law.

### Law Firms and Nonlawyers

Law firms, whether in the form of professional corporations or associations, may not be set up in such a way that a nonlawyer owns an interest therein (except for a fiduciary representative during the administration of an estate), a nonlawyer is a corporate officer or director thereof, or a nonlawyer has the right to direct or control a lawyer’s professional judgment. [RPC 5.4(d)]

---

## LAW-RELATED (ANCILLARY) SERVICES

Lawyers are permitted to provide law-related services to clients. Law-related services (often referred to as ancillary services) are services that might reasonably be performed in conjunction with (and are related to) the provision of legal services and that are not prohibited as unauthorized practice of law when provided by a nonlawyer. Examples of law-related services include financial planning, accounting, trust services, real estate counseling, and tax return preparation. A lawyer is subject to the Rules of Professional Conduct with respect to the provision of law-related services if she provides those services under circumstances that are not distinct from her provision of legal services to clients. [RPC 5.7(a)(1)]

### Services Provided by Entity Controlled by Lawyer
When the law-related services are provided by a separate entity controlled in whole or in part by a lawyer, the lawyer is subject to the Rules of Professional Conduct with respect to those services unless she takes reasonable measures to ensure that the recipient of the services knows that the services provided by the entity are not legal services and that the protections of the lawyer-client relationship do not apply. [RPC 5.7(a)(2)]
